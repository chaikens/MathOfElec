Resistive Networks, Linear Spaces and Tutte Polynomials

Seth Chaiken


We survey how 
combinatorial theory emerges when quantities or relations
of linear electrical network analysis are expressed as lines or more
generally affine linear subspaces.  Our story ranges over
Thevenin and Norton's theorems, load line analysis, exterior algebra
and linear dependence
of network behavior on parameters expressed as Tutte recursion, and a role of
oriented matroids in the analysis of jump phenomena of non-linear systems.
