\block{History}{
  \alert{Not well-known 1847 graph theory paper!} Kirchhoff's\cite{Kirchhoff}  ``Matrix Tree Theorem'' paraphrased:
  The solution to the linear resistive electrical network (Kirchhoff's and Ohm's laws)
  problem is comprised of ratios of certain tree or forest enumerators.

  Maxwell\cite{MaxR}
  expressed those problems with matrices.  EEs call Kirchhoff's result ``Maxwell's rule.''
  

  The theorem only for $\ext{N}_\alpha=\ext{N}_\beta$, with a lot of background and motivation
  appears in \cite{TutteEx}.  See \cite{sdcOMP} for our setup related to oriented matroids and their relation to
  non-linear electrical network problem well-posedness.
