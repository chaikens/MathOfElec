An Exterior Algebra Valued Tutte Function on Linear Matroids or their Pairs

The matrix tree theorem expresses the basis enumeration Tutte function (spanning tree count of connected graphic matroids) as a determinant--a minor of the graph's Laplacian. We will generalize the choice of a root vertex for the trees by distinguishing a fixed set P of p matroid elements, which we will call ports, a word from engineering. We then define a function from k-linear matrix representations of matroids M (or pairs (M1,M2)), whose ground sets include P, into the (Grassmannian of) p dimensional k-linear subspaces of k^(2p). We express this subspace value as a decomposible (i.e. product of vectors) element in the exterior algebra (of anti-symmetric tensors) over k^(2p), in a standard way.  The result is a restricted or set-pointed Tutte function T(M,M) or T(M1,M2) that satisfies sign-corrected forms of the two familiar identities for deletion/contraction of elements not in P, and for disjoint union. Note that these identities are in exterior algebra, whose multiplication is anti-commutative. This generalizes the all-minors directed graph matrix tree theorem (proved combinatorially by the author) because those minors are the coefficients in the expansion of T's value over the standard basis--they are the standardized Plucker coordinates for the dimension p subspace T's value represents.  An unusual feature for this Tutte-like function is that when k is ordered so the matroids are oriented, T can distinguish different orientations of the same matroid.  This poster surveys previously reported results of the author. Potential applications are sought!
