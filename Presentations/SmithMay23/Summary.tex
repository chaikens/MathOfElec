\block{Summary}{
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Usual parametrized Tutte functions $F$ are valued in comm. rings.
  \item
    Matrix Tree Theorem: The tree enumerator Tutte function is a determinant.
  \item
    Our generalization of the represented matroid basis enumerating determinant
    is a restricted Tutte function valued in exterior algebras (ie., anti-symmetric
    tensor spaces.)
  \item
    Restricted (against set $P$) aka set $P$ pointed, $P$-``ported'' $F$
    \[
    F(N,P) = r_e F(N\setminus e)+ g_e F(N/e)\]
    only when non-loop non-coloop $e\not\in P$.
  \item
    $P$ will play the role of graph vertices, to generalize deleting any
    equal sized row and col. sets from the Laplacian in the All-Minors Matrix
    Tree Theorem.
  \item
    Our Tutte function's values are {exterior products of vectors}. Thus
    they carry $\binom{2p}{p}$ determinants--each one is a Tutte function!
    Multiplication, occuring when $N$ is a direct sum, is anti-commutative.
    \item WRITE ABT orientations of two parallel edges..
  \end{enumerate}
