\maketitle

It is natural and useful to perform Tutte decomposition with
one or more ``port'' elements distinguished so they are not
deleted or contracted, or are deleted or contracted after all others.
Suppose also that parameters, representing say probability, electrical
resistance or conductance, or edge sign in a planar graph associated to
a knot or link diagram by the medial construction, etc., are attached to 
elements and indecomposibles.  We first review and extend conditions
given by Zaslavsky, Bollob\'{a}s-Riordan, Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi, and 
Diao-Hetyei for a parametrized ported Tutte function to be well-defined.
We then give applications to graphs.  We also report how these
methods may apply to the conjecture of Grimmett-Winker, Kahn and Pemantle
that the occurances of two given edges in random spanning forest subgraphs
are negatively correlated.  The methods include a function of two graphs
that obeys ported parametrized Tutte identities in each variable, and
a combinatorial formula for the correlation conjectured by Wagner.

Some of this work is in a collaboration with David Wagner and Bill Jackson
initiated during the Program in Combinatorics and Statistical Mechanics
supported by the Newton Institute, Cambridge, UK, Jan-July 2008; and it is
currently supported by a Sabbatical from the University at Albany, 2008-2009.
