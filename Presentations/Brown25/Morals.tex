  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Distinguish matroid element ``ports'' associated with 
    electric or elastic system parameter and solution variables of interest.
    (All vars are paired: (voltage, current), (force, displacement), etc.
    One gets a pair of submodels with dual matroids in elementary
    situations; not duals otherwise.)
  \item
    Exterior algebra forms of deletion and contraction of a non-port
    yield a pair of simpler systems.
  \item
    Cancelling non-port elements with a kind of bilinear pairing
    yields the parameter/solution variables of interest relation,
    in the form of an
    \textbf{exterior algebra valued function} of systems,
    that \textbf{is a Tutte function} (when the minor and
    direct sum operations are sign-consistent).
  \end{enumerate}

  With the suitable incidence matrix form, we get the all-minors matrix tree
  theorem; but all the minors are packed into \textbf{one exterior algebra
    object} that is a Tutte function of graphs.
