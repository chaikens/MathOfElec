  \begin{itemize}

  \item The bottom reviews how the Cauchy-Binet theorem proves a graph's Laplacian
    determinant counts spanning trees.

  \item In first order stiffness theory
    there are matrices like the Laplacian, ...
      and Poisson and Dirichlet type problems.

  \item I'd be very happy to meet collaborators to help go from my electrical network
    thinking with its one-dimensional voltages and currents to the higher dimensional
    world of this workshop, and see what problems are analogous to electrical ones.

  \item Briefly,  (1) solution matrices can be encoded as pure exterior algebra elements, (2) As such,
    they package Plucker coordinate values, and (3) the solution is a Tutte function of a class
    of problems.

  \item
    Entries in solution matrices for nice electrical network analyses ... and also larger minors
    in those matrices ... turn out to be ratios of those Plucker coordinates. 

    \item I conjecture that's true and might be interesting for stiffness problems.
    
  \item Now some details.
      
  \item We start with two matrices, $N$-Alpha and Beta.  A column label, identfying
    a matroid element, is either hatted or not, ... but the same letter never appears
    both hatted and not over the same matrix.  We can therefore consider the unhatted letters to
    belong to a special basis in a big space generated by all matroid elements, and consider
    each hatted version to be the corresponding dual vector.

  \item We make two pure exterior algebra elements,  boldface
    $\mathbf{N}$-Alpha and Beta to represent the row spaces.  From now on, every pure, that is,
    indecomposible element, 
    a product of vectors and or dual vectors, we will call an ``extensor''.  

  \item We make them by formally multiplying the matrix row sums after plugging
    in hatted or unhatted versions of unique symbols naming the columns, and using
    the anticommutive exterior product.   The coefficient of a given monomial is therefore
    a Plucker coordinate, the determinant of the submatrix with the given column
    labels.

  \item We construct function $L$ by a bilinear pairing so 
    $L$'s extensor value represents a linear endomorphism on
    the exterior algebra generated by free p type symbols.  For this, each hatted
    symbol e-hat or p-hat functions as the dual of the vector symbolized by e or p.  

\item Result 1 is that $L$ obeys Tutte's deletion and contraction identity:  BUT
  only for $e$ type elements, not the $p$'s.  

\item There is also a direct sum identity ... $L$ of a direct sum is an exterior product, not
  a commutative ring product.

\item We have TO CAREFULLY DEFINE the extensor operations for deletion \&
  contraction \& direct sum so the signs in the $L$--s we combine are consistent.

\item
  I find it interesting that, ... in order to get a Tutte function out
  of this, it seems require two special things.

\item
One is to make the Tutte function relative, ... to the set of ports $P$.

\item
  We need this because the $\mathbf{e}$---s  disappear when they are contracted or deleted.

\item
  I like to call the distinguised elements ports. ... We never delete or contract them.

%\item
%  Those port elements in the exterior algebra are vectors, and the hatted
%  ones are covectors, ie., 1-forms or dual vectors.

\item In applications, ports relate to variables used to specify inputs
  or parameters, ... like how much you push on nodes with forces or electric currents,
  and responses, ... like how the nodes move, or change their voltages.

\item But this setup, you can interchange inputs and responses ANY WAY that the
  relevant matroids encode is feasible and well-posed.  Electrical engineers would
  call $L$ a MULTIPORT LINEAR DEVICE model.

  %The cascade form of two ports has at the first port both the voltage and current for independent, input
  %variables and at the second port, both the voltage and current are response variables. (Not for a
  %lighting talk, just thinking.)

\item
  Two, it seems this extensor Tutte function needs to be constructed on 
  two arguments, labelled $\alpha$ \& $\beta$.

%\item
%  We recover the basis enumerator when the two are equal and $P$ is empty.  It
  %  is the sum of squared determinants though, not always ones.
  % (This idea is subsumed by the new introduction)

\item
  Result 2 is a Cauchy-Binet kind of expansion. The bracketed minors denote sums of terms
  because they are extensor representations of minors without any non-port elements.
  The notation hides common basis expansions of many different minors our two matroids.

%\item
%  In my old writeup, I start with $\mathbf{N}$-Alpha, exterior multiply it by the DUAL of
%  $\mathbf{N}$-Beta,
%  and finally contract all the $e$--s.  A non-zero exterior product is disjoint subspace join, and
%  contraction is projection. I call that the Laplace form.  

\item
  I finish with some take-homes and morals, and my name, Seth Chaiken
  of Albany, NY.

  \item
  Three punchlines:  One, ports are IM-PORT-ANT.
  Two, let's do matroid recursion on matrices in exterior algebra.
  Three, we find a Tutte function there.
  Thank you!
