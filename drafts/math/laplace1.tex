(a functional transformation, function $->$ function)

(a complex, more specifically, analytic function)

(a generating function, analog with $\int dt$ in place of $\sum$)

(approximation relations with dicrete generating functions, 
aka ``$z$-transform''. Digital signal processing implements or
is approximately related to analog signal processing.)

(a formal ratio of an extensor's Plucker coordinates)

(eigenvalue of eigenvector $e^{s t}$ under a differential operator eg 
$(a\frac{d}{dx}^2 + b\frac{d}{dx} + c)(e^{st}) = (as^2 +bs + c)e^{st}$

(formal expression for impedances $R$, $1/Cs$, $Ls$)

(linear differential operator $s(f) = \frac{d}{dx}f$)

(deletion/contraction, 
``capacitor shorts out on high $s$, inductor opens on low $s$'' 
\cite{intuitAna})

(characterization of ``responses'' defined among port variables)

(?? Indicator of a step respone)

(asymptotic expansions as $s\rightarrow\infty$
and $s\rightarrow 0$)

\noindent\textbf{More and more}

(asymptotic behavior of a generating function's coefficients, which are
the generated function's values, determined by analytic properties of the
generated function.  Relate EE, circuits and signals literature to 
statistical mechanics and combinatorics.  
\cite{statMechForGraphers,multivarHalfPlane,AnalyticCombinatoricsBook})

(random generation: \cite{BoltzmanSampRandCombGen})

(geometry of phase shifts)

(risetime related to basic topology, graph theory, topology of lumped
networks expressed by oriented matroids)

(FUTURE hopefully not too much: Complex oriented matroids of Anderson, et.
al. \cite{complexOM})
