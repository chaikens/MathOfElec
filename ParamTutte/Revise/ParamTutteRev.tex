\begin{abstract}
We discuss Tutte functions of parametrized matroids in which
certain ``port'' elements have been distinguished.
The port elements are held back from deletion and contraction
during Tutte decompositions.  Conditions on the parameters
and the values for matroids or oriented matroids on port elements
necessary and sufficient for a ported Tutte function $T$ to be well-defined
are proved.  Activities based expressions and the corresponding
interval partitions of the boolean lattice of subsets
without port elements are 
given, for all recursive computations of $T(M)$, not just those
based on an element order.  These are then specialized to
a corank-nullity and a geometric lattice expansion for the ported
generalization of normal Tutte functions.

\section{Introduction}

Two of the natural, known and useful generalizations
of the Tutte equations and the resulting
Tutte polynomials and decompositions occur when:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A set $P$ of distinguished elements, which
we call ``ports'', is specified.  The
operations of deleting and contracting 
non-separator $e$,
and the factoring out of a separator $e$
so $T(G\oplus e)=XT(G)$ or $YT(G)$ depending
on whether $e$ is a coloop or loop, are then
restricted only to $e\not\in P$.  See \cite{SetPointedLV,MR0419272}
where the Tutte polynomials are called ``set-pointed'',
\cite{sdcPorted}, and Brylawsky's early work 
\cite{BrylawskiPointed} on the $|P|=1$ case.
\item
Four parameters $x_e, y_e, X_e, Y_e$ are 
given for each element $e$.  $x_e$ and $y_e$
are coefficients in the additive Tutte 
equation for contracting and deleting
$e$ when $e$ is a non-separator.  $X_e$
and $Y_e$ generalize the common $X$ and $Y$
above to different parameters for
different $e$.  When combined with (1), 
parameters are given only for $e\not\in P$.
See \cite{MR93a:05047,BollobasRiordanTuttePolyColored,Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}.
\end{enumerate}
In this note, we give common generalizations
for matroids of pertinent definitions and methods,
and prove the results.
Our synthesis began with
\cite{TutteEx}, where the term ``port'' is
motivated by an application;
but this application requires only those Tutte 
functions that are both {\bf strong} 
($T(M^1\oplus M^2)=T(M^1)T(M^2)$) and {\bf normal}
(have a corank-nullity generating function expression)
\cite{MR93a:05047}.  Additional progress is reported
in \cite{RelTuttePoly} where the functions
are called ``relative'' Tutte polynomials; and 
they have a very different application.
The Tutte functions we treat are those only required,
in addition to the parametrized additive identity,
to satisfy $T(M)=X_eT(M\setminus e)$ or
$T(M)=Y_eT(M\setminus e)$ for separators $e\not\in P$,
rather than $T(M^1\oplus M^2)=T(M^1)T(M^2)$.  
They are called {\bf separator-strong}\cite{JoAndTom}.
$E(M)$ denotes $S(M)\setminus P$, the
elements of $M$ not in $P$.
We present
two principal outcomes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
The extension is straighforward
but has the novel feature that the resulting
Tutte functions might depend on the orientation
of an oriented matroid $M$, not just on the
underlying matroid.  The Tutte function
depends on $I(Q)$, the initial values on
minors $Q = $ $M/A\setminus (E\setminus A)$
$=$ $M/A|P$ which are called {\bf $P$-quotients},
in addition to the parameters.  The three known
\cite{MR93a:05047,BollobasRiordanTuttePolyColored,Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}
families
of polynomial conditions necessary and sufficient 
for the Tutte function to be well-defined 
are generalized to five; the two new ones involve
pairs $\{e,f\}\subseteq E$ connected to $P$.  

We were surprised that although each condition
is polynomial in parameters for 2 or 3 elements of $E$,
each polynomial is \emph{a multiple of
$I(Q)$} for \emph{only one} $Q$.

\item
When the conditions are satisfied, all recursive
computations based on the ported Tutte equations give the
same result.  The Tutte computation tree formalism 
\cite{GordonMcMachonGreedoid}
enables us to 
define an activities-type expansion for every such
computation, not just those based on a linear
ordering of $E$.  The known theory generalizes to
the ported case, including for example, interval
partitions of the Boolean lattice $2^{E}$.  
There is 
one term and boolean interval for
each independent subset $F\subseteq E$ for
which $F\cup P$ is spanning; such $F$ specialize
to bases when $P=\emptyset$.
The blocks
of such interval partitions are then partitioned according
to the common $Q=M/A|P$ for $A$ in each block.
\end{enumerate}

The conditions, similar to ours, on the parameters 
only given in \cite{RelTuttePoly}
are necessary and sufficient
for the Tutte function to be well-defined
\emph{for all} choices of initial values $I(Q)$.
Our conditions are derived without
this universal quantification.  Hence a factor $I(Q)$
appears in each.  They reveal 
exactly which polynomials involving any $I(Q)$
must vanish depending on the structure of 
the family on which the Tutte function is
well-defined.  Also, our proof technique is
different; it generalizes that 
in \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}.

We only address 
\emph{separator-strong}
Tutte functions of matroids.
Ported generalizations of 
the 
formula
$T(\emptyset) T(M^1\oplus M^2) 
= T(M^1) T(M^2))$
and related results about strong Tutte functions\cite{MR93a:05047},
direct sums 
and graphs (based on 
\cite{MR93a:05047,BollobasRiordanTuttePolyColored,Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}) are 
left for future publication.

\section{Matroid Tutte Function Characterization}
\label{ParamTutteSec}

\begin{definition}
\label{SSTMDefinition}
Let $P$ be a set of \textbf{ports} and $\mathcal{C}$ be a class of matroids or
oriented matroids closed under taking minors or oriented minors
by deleting or contracting only elements $e\not\in P$.
Such a $\mathcal{C}$ is called a \textbf{$P$-family}.  
Suppose $\mathcal{C}$ is
given with four parameters $(x_e,y_e,X_e,Y_e)$
in a commutative ring $R$, for each $e\not\in P$ that is an element
in some $M\in\mathcal{C}$.

A \textbf{separator-strong parametrized $P$-ported Tutte function}
$T$ maps $\mathcal{C}$ to $R$ or to an $R$-module and satisfies 
conditions 
\eqref{TA} and \eqref{TSSM} below for all $M\in\mathcal{C}$ and
all $e$ in $E(M)$.

\begin{equation}
\label{TA}
\tag{TA}
\begin{gathered}
T(M) = x_e T(M/e) + y_e T(M\setminus e) \\
\text{ if $e\not\in P$ and $e$ is a non-separator, 
       i.e., neither a loop nor a coloop.}
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
\label{TSSM}
\tag{TSSM}
\begin{gathered}
\text{If } e\not\in P\text{ is a coloop in }M\text{ then }
T(M)=X_e T(M/e).\\
\text{If } e\not\in P\text{ is a loop in }M\text{ then }
T(M)=Y_e T(M\setminus e).
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

\end{definition}

The ground set of $M\in\mathcal{C}$ is denoted by $S(M)$ and
$E(M) = S(M)\setminus P$, the ground set elements of $M$ that are 
not ports.  $U^{ef\ldots}_r$ denotes the uniform rank $r$ matroid 
on $\{e,f,\ldots\}\subseteq E$.
The $Q\in \mathcal{C}$ for which neither \eqref{TA} nor
\eqref{TSSM} apply, equivalently, $E(Q)=\emptyset$,
are called the \textbf{indecomposibles} or
\textbf{$P$-quotients} in $\mathcal{C}$.


\begin{prop}
\label{SameMinorProp}
Suppose $e,f$ are in series, or are in parallel, in matroid or
oriented matroid $M$.
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item 
(1) The minors $M/e\setminus f=M/f\setminus e$
are equal as matroids.
%\item 
(2) If $M$ is oriented, the oriented minors 
$M/e\setminus f=M/f\setminus e$ are equal as oriented matroids.
%\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
If $e,f$ are in series, note that $M/e\setminus f$ $=$
$M\setminus f/e$.  $e$ is a coloop in $M\setminus f$,
so $M\setminus f/e$ $=$ $M\setminus\{e,f\}$, which is
clearly the same matroid or oriented matroid if $e,f$
are interchanged.  The relevant theory of minors of oriented matroids
can be found in \cite{OMBOOK}.

If $e,f$ are in parallel, $e,f$ are in series in 
the matroid or oriented matroid dual $M^*$ of $M$.
By the first case, $M^*\setminus e/ f$ $=$
$M^*\setminus f/e$ as matroids or as oriented matroids.
Thus $M/e\setminus f$ $=$ $(M^*\setminus e/ f)^*$ $=$
$(M^*\setminus f/ e)^*$ $=$ $M/f\setminus e$ as matroids or
as oriented matroids.
\end{proof}



\begin{thm}[Ported Matroid ZBR Theorem]
\label{BigTheorem}
The following two statements are equivalent.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $T$ from $\mathcal{C}$ to $R$ or an $R$-module is a $P$-ported 
separator-strong parametrized
Tutte function with $R$-parameters $(x, y, X, Y)$ whose values 
$T(Q)$ on $P$-quotients $Q\in\mathcal{C}$ are the initial
values $I(Q)$.
\item
\begin{enumerate}
\item For every $M=U^{ef}_1\oplus Q\in\mathcal{C}$ with 
$P$-quotient $Q$ ($U^{ef}_1$ is a dyad), 
\[
I(Q)(x_e Y_f + y_e X_f) = 
I(Q)(x_f Y_e + y_f X_e).
\]
\item
For every $M=U^{efg}_2\oplus Q\in\mathcal{C}$ with 
$P$-quotient $Q$ ($U^{efg}_2$ is a triangle), 
\[
I(Q)X_g(x_e y_f + y_e X_f) = 
I(Q)X_g(x_f y_e + y_f X_e).
\]
\item
For every $M=U^{efg}_1\oplus Q\in\mathcal{C}$ with 
$P$-quotient $Q$  ($U^{efg}_1$ is a triad), 
\[
I(Q)Y_g(x_e Y_f + y_e x_f) = 
I(Q)Y_g(x_f Y_e + y_f x_e).
\]
\item
If $\{e,f\}=E(M)$ is a parallel pair connected to $P$, 
\[
I(Q)(x_e Y_f + y_e x_f) = 
I(Q)(x_f Y_e + y_f x_e)
\]
where $P$-quotient $Q=M/e\setminus f=M/f\setminus e$.
\item
If $\{e,f\}=E(M)$ is a series pair connected to $P$, 
\[
I(Q)(x_e y_f + y_e X_f) = 
I(Q)(x_f y_e + y_f X_e)
\]
where $P$-quotient $Q=M/e\setminus f=M/f\setminus e$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

When $P=\emptyset$, this reduces to the
Zaslavsky-Bollob\'{a}s-Riordan theorem 
for matroids\cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}:
Only $Q=\emptyset$ occurs and the last two conditions become
vacuous.

\begin{proof}
Our proof is the immediate result of adding considerations of ports to the
proof in \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}, there described
as ``a straightforward adaption of the proof of Theorem 3.3 of 
\cite{MR93a:05047}.''
We sketch the proof with a few details, pointing out differences from
\cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}.

As in \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}, 
the necessary relations are easy to deduce by 
applying \eqref{TA} and \eqref{TSSM} in two different
orders to a general configuration in each of the five families.

Now on to the converse.
As in \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}, the strategy
is to first verify
that the conditions imply $T(M)$ is well-defined for 
$n = \Card{E(M)} = 0, 1$ and $2$.  Note that
for us, $n$ does not count $|P\cap S(M)|$.
Second, we rely on the hypothesis the $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under
$P$-minors in order to verify
that in a larger minimum $n$ counterexample, the elements of
$E(M)$ are either all in series or all in parallel, 
and then the conditions
imply that all calculation orders give the same result.  All the cases involve
two different combinations of deleting and contracting of several elements
in $E(M)$ where both combinations produce the same $P$-quotient matroids
or oriented matroids.  

Let $M\in\mathcal{C}$ be a counterexample with minimum $n=|E(M)|$.
Therefore, whenever $M'$ is a proper $P$-minor of $M$,
$T(M')$ is well-defined.  \eqref{TA} and \eqref{TSSM}
have the property that given $M$ and $e\in E(M)$, exactly one equation
applies.  Therefore, 
calculations that yield different values for $T(M)$ must start with
reducing by different elements of $E(M)$.  Since $T(M)$ is given 
unambiguously by the initial value $I(M)$ when $n=0$, we can assume
$n\geq 2$.

$M$ cannot contain a separator $e\in E(M)$, because
this $e$ is a separator in every $P$-minor of $M$ containing $e$.
Therefore, as observed in \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}, every
computation has the same result $X_e T(M/e)$ or $Y_e T(M\setminus e)$ 
depending on whether $e$ is a coloop or a loop.

Let $e$ be one element in $E(M)$.  Since no element in $E(M)$ is a 
separator, $V=x_{e} T(M/{e}) + y_{e} T(M\setminus {e})$ is well-defined, 
and so is $x_{e'} T(M/{e'}) + y_{e'} T(M\setminus {e'})$ 
for each other $e'\in E$.
We follow \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi} and define
$D=\{e'\in E(M) \mid V=x_{e'} T(M/{e'}) + y_{e'} T(M\setminus {e'})\}$.  The 
induction
hypothesis then tells us 
that there is at least 
one  $f\in E(M)\setminus D$.  
(Recall $e, e', f\not\in P$.)

Suppose that $e$ is a separator in both $M\setminus f$ and 
$M/f$ and $f$ is a separator in both 
$M\setminus e$ and $M/e$.  Then, 
$T$ would
be well-defined for all four of these $P$-minors and so
we can write 
\[
T(M)=x_e x_f T(M/\{e,f\}) + x_e y_f T(M/e\setminus f)
+ y_e x_f T(M\setminus e/f)
+ y_e y_f T(M\setminus\{e,f\}).
\]
Both computations give the same value because in this situation
the reductions by $e$ and $f$ commute. 
So, for $M$ to be a counterexample, there must be $e\in D$
and $f\not\in D$ ($e, f\not\in P$)
to which one case of the following lemma applies:

\begin{lem}
\cite{MR93a:05047}
Let $e , f$ be nonseparators in a matroid $M$. Within each column the
statements are equivalent:

\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
$e$ is a separator in $M\setminus f$.
\item
$e$ is a coloop in $M\setminus f$.
\item
$e$ and $f$ are in series in $M$.
\item
$f$ is a separator in $M\setminus e$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
$e$ is a separator in $M/ f$.
\item
$e$ is a loop in $M/ f$.
\item
$e$ and $f$ are in parallel in $M$.
\item
$f$  is a separator in $M/e$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}
\end{lem}

We claim that one of the following five cases must be satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
$n=2$ and $E(M)=\{e,f\}$ is a dyad.
\item
$n\geq 3$ and $E(M)$ is a circuit not connected to $P$.
\item
$n\geq 3$ and $E(M)$ is a cocircut not connected to $P$.
\item
$n\geq 2$ and for some $\emptyset\neq P'\subseteq P$,
$P'\cup E(M)$ is a cocircuit.
\item
$n\geq 2$ and for some $\emptyset\neq P'\subseteq P$,
$P'\cup E(M)$ is a circuit.
\end{enumerate}

As in  \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}, we draw the conclusion that
if $e\in D$ and $f\not\in D$ then $e, f$ are either series or parallel. 
It was further proven that a series pair and a parallel pair cannot
have exactly one element in common.  Therefore, the pairs $e,f$ satisfying 
the conditions are either all series pairs or all parallel pairs.  By 
minimality of $n$, $E(M)$ is either an $n$-element parallel class or an 
$n$-element series class.  The last two cases are distinguished from
the first three according to whether or not $E(M)$ is disconnected or not
from elements of $P$ in matroid $M$.  We now use \eqref{TA} and \eqref{TSSM}
to show that, in each case, the calculations that start with $e$ and 
those that start with $f$
have the same result, which contradicts $e\in D$ and $f\not\in D$.

We give the details for case (d).  By hypothesis, 
each of $T(M/e)$, $T(M\setminus e)$, $T(M/f)$, $T(M\setminus f)$,
$T(M/f/e)=T(M/e/f)$, $T(M/e\setminus f)$ and 
$T(M/f\setminus e)$ is well-defined.  (Remark:
By Proposition \ref{SameMinorProp},
$M\setminus f/e$ $=$ 
$M\setminus e/f$.  

Starting with $e$ and with $f$, \eqref{TA} gives the two expressions:
\[
V= x_e T(M/e) + y_e x_f T(M\setminus e /f) + y_e y_f T(M\setminus e\setminus f)
\]
\[
V\neq 
   x_f T(M/f) + y_f x_e T(M\setminus f /e) + y_f y_e T(M\setminus f\setminus e)
\]
Let $M'$ be the $P$-minor obtained by deleting each element
in $E(M)$ except for $e$ and $f$ ($M'=M$ if $n=2$.)
Since 
$E(M')=\{e,f\}$ and $e,f$ are in parallel connected to $P$ within
$M'$, (d) of the hypotheses  tells us that
\[
I(Q) (x_e Y_f - y_f x_e) =
I(Q') (x_f Y_e - y_e x_f ),
\]
where $Q=M'/e \setminus f$, $Q'=M'/f \setminus e$.  
Since $e,f$ are in parallel within $M'$,
matroids
or oriented matroids $Q=Q'$ by Proposition \ref{SameMinorProp}.
Since $A=E(M)\setminus\{e,f\}$ is a set of loops ($\emptyset$ if $n=2$)
in
$M/e\setminus f$ ($N/e\setminus f$) and 
in $M/f\setminus e$ ($N/f\setminus e$), we 
write $Y_A=\prod_{a\in A}Y_a$ ($1$ if $A=\emptyset$)
and use \eqref{TSSM} to write
\[
T(M/e\setminus f) = Y_A I(Q ),\;\;
T(M/f\setminus e) = Y_A I(Q' ),
\]
\[
T(M/e) = Y_f Y_A I(Q ),\;\;\text{ and }\;\;
T(M/f) = Y_e Y_A I(Q' ).
\]
So, since $M\setminus f\setminus e=M\setminus e\setminus f$,
\[
x_e T(M/e) + y_e x_f T(M\setminus e /f)
=
x_f T(M/f) + y_f x_e T(M\setminus f /e)
\]
contradicts 
$V\neq 
x_f T(M/f) + y_f x_e T(M\setminus f /e) + y_f y_e T(M\setminus f\setminus e)$
The remaining cases can be completed analogously.  It might be
noted that our proof differs slightly from \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}
in that the cases of $n=3$ and $n\ge 4$ are not distinguished.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Universal Tutte Polynomial}
\label{UniversalSec}
It is easy to follow 
\cite{BollobasRiordanTuttePolyColored,Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi} to define
a universal, i.e., most general $P$-ported parametrized
Tutte function $T^{\mathcal{C}}$ for $\mathcal{C}$.
We take indeterminates $x_e, y_e, X_e, Y_e$ for each $e\in E(M), 
M\in\mathcal{C}$
and an indeterminate $[Q]$ for each $P$-quotient $Q\in\mathcal{C}$.
Let $\mathbb{Z}[x,y,X,Y]$ denote the integer polynomial ring generated by
the $x_e,y_e,X_e,Y_e$ indeterminates, and define $\widetilde{\mathbb{Z}}$
to be the $\mathbb{Z}[x,y,X,Y]$-module generated by the $[Q]$.  
Let $I^{\mathcal{C}}$ denote the ideal of $\widetilde{\mathbb{Z}}$ 
generated by the identities of Theorem \ref{BigTheorem}, comprising 
for example $[Q](x_eY_f+y_eX_f-x_fY_e-y_fX_e)$ for each instance of
case (a), etc.  The universal Tutte function has values in the
quotient module $\widetilde{\mathbb{Z}}/I^{\mathcal{C}}$.  Finally,
observe that the range of Tutte function $T$  can be considered to be the
$R$-module generated by the values $I(Q)$ where ring $R$ contains the
$x,y,X,Y$ parameters. If the $I(Q)\in R$, consider
the ring $R$ to be the $R$-module generated by $R$.
We follow \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi} to write
the corresponding consequence of Theorem \ref{BigTheorem}:

\begin{cor}
\label{UniversalCor}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a $P$-minor closed class of matroids or 
oriented matroids.  Then there is a 
$\widetilde{\mathbb{Z}}/I^{\mathcal{C}}$-valued function 
$T^{\mathcal{C}}$ on $\mathcal{C}$ with $T^{\mathcal{C}}(Q)=[Q]$ for each $P$-quotient
$Q\in\mathcal{C}$ that is a $P$-ported parametrized Tutte function
on $\mathcal{C}$ where the parameters are the 
$x, y, X, Y \in \widetilde{\mathbb{Z}}$.  Moreover, if $T$ is any $R$-parametrized
Tutte function with parameters $x'_e, y'_e, X'_e, Y'_e$, then $T$ is the
composition of $T^{\mathcal{C}}$ with the homomorphism determined by
$[Q]\rightarrow I(Q)=T(Q)$ for $P$-quotients $Q$ and 
$x_e\rightarrow x'_e$, etc., for each $e\in E(\mathcal{C})$.

\section{Tutte Computation Trees and Activities}
\label{Activity}

Zaslavsky\cite{MR93a:05047} noted that the 
\emph{basis} or \emph{activities}
expansion, introduced by Tutte
\cite{TutteDich,TutteGraphBook} for graphs, applies
to all well-defined parametrized 
Tutte functions whereas the 
parametrized corank-nullity generating function
expresses only a proper subset of them, which he called
normal.  We show
how to give activities-type expansions comprised of
one expansion for every recursive computation of
a ported Tutte function value, not just those
determined by a linear element ordering.
We apply to 
ported matroids the expansions based on
Tutte computation trees which were formalized
by 
McMahon and Gordon \cite{GordonMcMachonGreedoid}
for the purpose of analyzing Tutte polynomials
of greedoids.
Unlike matroids, some greedoids
do not have activities expansions for their Tutte polynomials
that derive from element orderings.

Ellis-Monaghan and 
Traldi \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi} remarked that the Tutte equation
approach appears to give a shorter proof of the ZBR theorem
than the activities expansion approach. 
The proofs by induction on $|E|$
demonstrate that every calculation of $T(M)$ from Tutte equations
produces the same result when the conditions on the parameters
and initial values are satisfied.  We then know immediately that
the polynomial expression
resulting from
a particular calculation equals the Tutte function value.
We suggest a heuristic reason why
the Tutte equation approach is more succinct:
The induction assures that
\emph{every} computation
with smaller $|E|$ gives the same result, not just those 
computations that are determined by linear orders on $E$.
%
Proofs of activities expansions for matroids, and their generalizations
for $P$-ported matroids, seem more informative and certainly
no harder when the expansions are derived from a general Tutte
computation tree, than when the expansions are only those
that result from an element order.   
From the retrospective that the Tutte equations
specify a non-deterministic recursive computation
\cite{Garey-Johnson}, it seems artificial to start with
element-ordered computations and then prove
first that all linear orders give the same result and 
second that it 
satisfies the Tutte equations, in order prove that 
all recursions give the same result.
We therefore
take advantage of the Tutte computation tree formalism
and the more general expansions it enables.

\subsection{Computation Tree Expansion}
\begin{definition}
Given $P$-ported matroid or oriented matroid $M$,
a \textbf{$P$-subbasis} $F$
is an independent set  with $F\subseteq E(M)$
(so $F\cap P=\emptyset$) for which $F\dunion P$ is a spanning set
for $M$
(in other words, $F$ spans $M/P$).
$\mathcal{B}_P(M)$ denotes the set of $P$-subbases.
\end{definition}

Equivalent definitions were given in \cite{SetPointedLV}
and in \cite{RelTuttePoly}.   The following is immediate and
useful:

\begin{prop}
For every $P$-subbasis $F$ there exists an independent set $Q\subseteq P$
that extends $F$ to a basis $F\dunion Q\in \mathcal{B}(M)$ of $M$.
Conversely, if $B\in\mathcal{B}(M)$ then $F=B\cap E=B\setminus P$
is a $P$-subbasis.
\end{prop}

\begin{definition}[Computation Tree, following \cite{GordonMcMachonGreedoid}]
\label{CompTreeDef}
A $P$-ported (Tutte) computation tree for $M$ is a
binary tree whose root is labeled by $M$ and which satisfies:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $M$ has non-separating elements not in $P$, then 
the root has two subtrees and there exists one such element $e$ for which 
one subtree is a computation tree
for $M/e$ and the other subtree is a computation tree for 
$M\setminus e$.

The branch to $M/e$ is labeled with ``$e$ contracted'' and 
the other branch is labeled ``$e$ deleted''.
\item Otherwise (i.e., every element in $E(M)$
is separating) the root is a leaf.  

Each leaf is labelled with a $P$-quotient $Q$ plus a direct sum
of loop or coloop matroids on elements respectively $e$ or $f$ in $E$, 
expressed
as $[Q]\prod X_e \prod Y_f$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

%Figure \ref{c4p2TwoFigure} illustrates two computation trees; it 
%is conventional to slant contraction edges to the left and
%deletion edges to the right.

\begin{definition}[Activities with respect to a leaf]
\label{ActivityTreeDef}
For a $P$-ported Tutte computation tree for $M$,
a given leaf, and the path from the root to this leaf:
\begin{itemize}
\item Each $e\in E(M)$ labeled ``contracted'' along this path
is called \textbf{internally passive}.
\item Each coloop $e\in E(M)$ in the leaf's matroid is
called \textbf{internally active}.
\item Each $e\in E(M)$ labeled ``deleted'' along this path
is called \textbf{externally passive}.
\item Each loop $e\in E(M)$ in the leaf's matroid is
called \textbf{externally active}.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{prop}
Given a leaf of a $P$-ported Tutte computation tree for $M$,
the set of internally active or internally passive elements 
constitutes a 
$P$-subbasis of $M$ which we say 
\textbf{belongs to the leaf}.  
Furthermore, every $P$-subbasis $F$ of $N$ belongs to a unique leaf.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
For the purpose of this proof, let us extend Definition \ref{ActivityTreeDef}
so that, given a computation tree with a given node $i$ 
labeled by matroid $M_i$,
$e\in E$ is called internally passive when $e$ is labeled 
``contracted'' along the path from root $M$ to
node $i$.  Let $IP_i$ denote the set of such internally passive 
elements.

It is easy to prove by induction on the length of the root to node $i$ path
that
(1) $IP_i\cup S(M_i)$ spans $M$ and 
(2) $IP_i$ is an independent set in $M$.  The proof
of (1) uses the fact that elements labeled deleted are non-separators.  The
proof of (2) uses the fact that for each non-separator 
$f\in M/IP_i$, $f\cup IP_i$ is independent in $M$.

These properties applied to a leaf demonstrate the first conclusion,
since each $e\in E$ in the leaf's matroid must be a separator by Definition 
\ref{CompTreeDef}.

Given a $P$-subbasis $F$, we can find the unique leaf with the
algorithm below.  Note that it also operates on arbitrary subsets of $E$.

\textbf{Tree Search Algorithm:} Beginning
at the root, descend the tree according to the rule: At each branch node,
descend along the edge labeled ``$e$-contracted'' if $e\in F$ and along
the edge labeled ``$e$-deleted'' otherwise (when $e\not\in F$).
\end{proof}

We leave the reader to check that 
the classsical element-order based activities
expansion, as extended with ports explicitly
in\cite{RelTuttePoly}, is reproduced with 
the unique $P$-ported
computation tree in which the greatest non-separator $e\in E$ is
deleted and contracted in the matroid at each tree node,
when the elements are ordered
so $p\in P$ is 
before each $e\not\in P$.

\begin{definition}
\label{ActivitySymbolsDef}
Given a computation tree for 
$P$-ported (oriented) matroid $M$,
each $P$-subbasis $F\subseteq E$
is associated with the following subsets of non-port elements
defined according to Definition \ref{ActivityTreeDef}
from the unique leaf determined by the algorithm given above.
\begin{itemize}
\item $IA(F)\subseteq F$ denotes the set of internally active elements,
\item $IP(F)\subseteq F$ denotes the set of internally passive elements,
\item $EA(F)\subseteq E\setminus F$ 
denotes the set of externally active elements,
and 
\item $EP(F)\subseteq E\setminus F$ denotes the set of externally
passive elements.
\item $A(F)=IA(F)\dunion EA(F)$ denotes the set of active elements.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{prop}
\label{PartitionProposition}
Given a $P$-ported Tutte computation tree for
$M$, 
the boolean lattice of subsets of $E=E(M)$
is partitioned by the collection of
intervals $[IP(F),F\dunion EA(F)]$ 
determined from the collection
of $P$-subbases $F$, which correspond to the leaves.
(Note $F\dunion EA(F)=IP(F)\dunion A(F)$.)

Each $A\in [IP(F),F\dunion EA(F)]$ in one interval determines the
same matroid or oriented matroid  $P$-quotient
by $M/A|P=M/IP(F)|P$.

The boolean lattice of subsets of $E=E(M)$
is also partitioned by the collection of
intervals $[EP(F),(E\setminus F)\dunion IA(F)]$.
(Note $(E\setminus F)\dunion IA(F)$ $=$ $EP(F)\dunion A(F)$.)

Each $A'\in [EP(F), (E\setminus F)\dunion IA(F)]$ of one of these
intervals determines the same matroid or oriented matroid
$P$-quotient by $M\setminus B'/(E\setminus B')$
$=$ $M/F|P$.

For a given $F\in\mathcal{B}_P(M)$, $A\subseteq E$ satisfies
$A\in [IP(F),F\dunion EA(F)]$ if and only if 
$(E\setminus A)\in [EP(F),(E\setminus F)\dunion IA(F)]$. 
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Every subset $A\subseteq E=E(M)\setminus P$ belongs to the
unique interval corresponding to the unique leaf found by the tree search 
algorithm given at the end of the previous proof.  

$P$-quotient $M/A|P$ is independent of the order of the
deletions and contractions.  So let $IP(F)\subseteq A$ be contracted
and $(E\setminus EA(F))\subseteq (E\setminus A)$ be deleted first.
The remaining elements of $E$ are loops or coloops, so the $P$-quotient
is independent of whether they are deleted or contracted.

The dual of that tree search algorithm, which descends along
the edge labelled ``$e$-deleted'' if $e\in A'$, etc., will find the
unique leaf whose interval $[EP(F),E\setminus F\cup IA(F)]$ contains
$A'$.

When $A\in[IP(F),F\cup EA(F)]$, the dual algorithm applied to
$A'=E\setminus A$ will find the same leaf.  The $P$-quotient is
determined by $IP(F)$.
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The following generalizes the activities expansion expression given
in \cite{MR93a:05047} to ported (oriented) matroids, as well as 
Theorem 8.1 of \cite{SetPointedLV}. 

\begin{prop}
\label{TuttePolyExpression}
Given parameters $x_e$, $y_e$, $X_e$, $Y_e$, and 
$P$-ported matroid or oriented matroid $M$
the Tutte polynomial expression
determined by the sets in Definition 
\ref{ActivitySymbolsDef} 
from a computation tree is 
given by
\begin{equation}
\tag{PAE}
\label{PAE}
\sum_{F\in \mathcal{B}_P}[M/F|P]
\;X_{IA(F)}\;x_{IP(F)}\;Y_{EA(F)}\;y_{EP(F)}.
\end{equation}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
\eqref{PAE} is an expression constructed by applying some of the
Tutte equations.  One monomial results from each leaf.
In that leaf's matroid,
each active element is a separator, and the active elements
contribute $X_{IA(F)}Y_{EA(F)}$ to the monomial.
The passive elements which contribute
$x_{IP(F)}y_{EP(F)}$
are the tree
edge labels in the path from the root to the leaf.
Each $M/F|P$ denotes a $P$-quotient of $M$, so the
expression is a polynomial in the parameters and in the
initial values.  
Therefore, \eqref{PAE} expressions the result of
the calculation when one substitutes
$[M/F|P]=I(M/F|P)$.
\end{proof}

From Corollary \ref{UniversalCor} we conclude:
\begin{thm}
\label{ActivitiesTheorem}
For every $P$-ported parametrized Tutte function $T$ 
on $\mathcal{C}$ into 
ring $R$ or an $R$-module,
for every computation tree for $M\in\mathcal{C}$,
(and so for every ordering of $E(M)$), 
the polynomial expression \eqref{PAE} equals 
$T^{\mathcal{C}}(M)$ of Corollary \ref{UniversalCor}.
\end{thm}


\subsection{Expansions of Normal Tutte Functions}
\label{NormalSubSec}
After a notational translation, 
Zaslavsky's \cite{MR93a:05047} definition of {\bf normal} Tutte 
functions becomes
those for which $T(\emptyset)=1$, and for which there exist
$u$, $v\in R$ so that for each $e\in E(M)$,

\begin{equation}
\tag{CNF}
\label{CNF}
X_e = x_e + uy_e \text{ and } Y_e = y_e + vx_e.
\end{equation}

The equations of
Theorem \ref{BigTheorem} are readily verified and
so we naturally extend this definition, with the
$T(\emptyset)=1$ condition dropped, to 
ported separator-strong parametrized Tutte functions.
All the expressions for normal Tutte
functions are therefore in the ring freely generated by
$u$, $v$, the $x_e, y_e$ and the $[Q]$.
We can now generalize some known 
expansions for the Tutte polynomial $T^{\mathcal{C}}$
after the \eqref{CNF} substitution.
The rank function for $M$ is denoted by $r$.


\begin{cor}[Boolean Interval Expansion]
\label{NormalActProp}
The following activities and boolean interval expansion formula
is universal for normal Tutte functions:
\[
T^{\mathcal{C}}(M)=
\sum_{F\in \mathcal{B}_P}[M/F|P]
%\left(
\Big(
\sum_{\substack{
       IP(F)\subseteq K \subseteq F\\
       EP(F)\subseteq L \subseteq E\setminus F
      }}
 x_{K\cup (E\setminus F\setminus L)}\;
 v^{\Card{E\setminus F\setminus L}}\;
 y_{L\cup (F\setminus K)}\;
 u^{\Card{F\setminus K}}\;\;
%\right)
\Big)
\]
\end{cor}

\begin{proof} 
Substitute 
\eqref{CNF} 
into $T^{\mathcal{C}}(M)$
and use
$IP(F)\dunion IA(F) =F$ and 
$EP(F)\dunion EA(F)=E\setminus F$
from
Definition \ref{ActivitySymbolsDef}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}
\label{KLAlemma}
Given $F\in\mathcal{B}_P$,
$IP(F)$ spans $EA(F)$.

The pairs $(K,L)$ for which 
       $IP(F)\subseteq K \subseteq F$ and 
       $EP(F)\subseteq L \subseteq E\setminus F$
are in a one-to-one correspondance
with the $A$ satisfying $IP(F)\subseteq A\subseteq F\dunion EA(F)$
given by $A=K\dunion (E\setminus F)\setminus L$.


For every such $A$, 
\[
\Card{F\setminus K}=r(M)-r(M/F|P)-r(A)
\]
and
\[
\Card{E\setminus F\setminus L} = \Card{A}-r(A).
\]
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
(See Figure \ref{Venn} in Appendix.) By our definition of activities,
after all the elements of $IP(F)$ are contracted, all elements 
in $EA(F)$ are loops.
(Note none of these elements are ports.)

Let 
$A=K\dunion (E\setminus F\setminus L)$.
By our definition of activities,
$IP(F)\dunion IA(F)=F$, so $IP(F)\subseteq A$.
Similarly,  
$EP(F)\dunion EA(F)=E\setminus F$, so 
$A\cap(E\setminus F)\subseteq EA(F)$.
Hence 
$IP(F)\subseteq A\subseteq F\dunion EA(F)$.
Conversely, given such an $A$, 
take $K=A\cap F$ and $L=(E\setminus F)\setminus A$.

Since $IP(F)$ spans $EA(F)$ and $K\supseteq IP(F)$, $K$ spans $EA(F)$.
Since $A\subseteq K\dunion EA(F)$, $K$ spans $A$.
$K\subseteq F$, $F$ is a $P$-subbasis, so $K$ and $F$ are independent,
hence $\Card{K}=r(K)=r(A)$ and $\Card{F}=r(F)$.  
Therefore, $\Card{F\setminus K}=r(F)-r(A)$.

Since $F$ is a $P$-subbasis, $r(F\cup P)=r(M)$.
By definition of contraction, $r(M/F|P)=r(F\cup P) - r(F)$,
so $r(M/F|P)=r(M)-r(F)$.  We conclude 
$\Card{F\setminus K}=r(M)-r(M/F|P)-r(A)$.

$E\setminus F\setminus L = A\setminus K$, so
$\Card{E\setminus F\setminus L} = \Card{A}-\Card{K}$.
As above, $\Card{K}=r(A)$, so the last equation follows.
\end{proof}


\begin{cor}
\begin{equation}
\label{FIntervalExpansion}
T^{\mathcal{C}}(M)=
\sum_{F\in \mathcal{B}_P}[M/F|P]
%\left(
\Big(
\sum_{IP(F)\subseteq A \subseteq (F\!\dunionsubscript\! EA(F))}
 x_{A}
 y_{E\setminus A}
 u^{r(M)-r(M/F|P)-r(A)}
 v^{\Card{A}-r(A)}
%\right)
\Big)
\end{equation}
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
Apply Lemma \ref{KLAlemma} to the inner sum in
Proposition \ref{NormalActProp}.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}[Corank-nullity expansion]
\begin{equation}
\tag{PGF}
\label{PGF}
T^{\mathcal{C}}(M) = \sum_{A\subseteq E(M)}[M/A \mid P]x_A y_{E\setminus A}
u^{r(M)-r(M/A\mid P)-r(A)}
v^{|A|-r(A)}.
\end{equation}
\end{thm}

Remark: This extends to separator-strong ported Tutte functions
with parameters on possibly oriented matroids
an expression from \cite{MR0419272} reproduced in \cite{sdcPorted}.  It can
also be proved by corank-nullity generating function methods.

\begin{proof}
By Proposition \ref{PartitionProposition}, given any Tutte computation tree,
the lattice of subsets of $E(M)$ is partitioned
into intervals corresponding to $P$-subbases $\mathcal{B}_P$.  
In each interval, 
$P$-quotient $M/F|P$ is equal to 
$M/A|P$ (as a matroid or oriented matroid)
for 
$A\in [IP(F),F\cup EA(F)]$.
Hence we can 
interchange the summations in \eqref{FIntervalExpansion} and write
\eqref{PGF}.
\end{proof}


\begin{prop}[Geometric Lattice Flat Expansion]
\label{GFlatProp}
Let $M$ be an oriented or unoriented.
In the formula below,
$F$ and $G$ range over the geometric lattice of flats 
$\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}(M|E)$ contained
in $M$ restricted to $E = E(M)$.  
($E$ is the top of $\mathcal{L}$ and $\le$
is its partial order.)
\[
T^{\mathcal{C}}(M) = \sum_{Q} [Q]
      \sum_{\substack{F\leq E\\
                     [M/F|P]=[Q]
           }}
                   u^{r(M)-r(Q)-r(F)}
                   v^{-r(F)}
                   \sum_{G\le F}
                   \mu(G,F)
                   \prod_{e\in G}
                    (y_e+x_ev)
\]
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
This 
generalizes and 
follows the steps for theorem 8 in \cite{sdcPorted}.  (See Appendix.)
\end{proof}

\section{Proof of Proposition \ref{GFlatProp}}

For each subset $A\subseteq E$, 
$[Q] = [M/A|P] = [M/F|P]$ is determined by the unique flat $F$
in $L(E)$ spanned by $A\subseteq E$.  So, we write \eqref{PGF}
by
\[
T^{\mathcal{C}}(M) = 
     \sum_{Q} [Q] \sum_{\substack{
                     F\in \mathcal{L}\\
                     [M/F|P]=[Q]
                      }}
      \sum_{\substack{
             A\subseteq F\\
             A\text{ spans }F
          }}
      x_A y_{E\setminus A}
      u^{r(M)-r(M/A\mid P)-r(A)}
      v^{|A|-r(A)}.
\]
Factoring, we get
\[
T^{\mathcal{C}}(M) = 
     \sum_{Q} [Q] \sum_{\substack{
                     F\in \mathcal{L}\\
                     [M/F|P]=[Q]
                      }}
      u^{r(M)-r(Q)-r(F)}
      v^{-r(F)}
      \sum_{\substack{
             A\subseteq F\\
             A\text{ spans }F
          }}
      x_A y_{E\setminus A}
      v^{|A|}.
\]
$A$ is summed over the spanning sets of $F$.  Let $Z(F)$ denote
this last sum.  Since every subset of $F$ spans some flat
in $\mathcal{L}$,
\[
\sum_{0\le G \le F}Z(G) = \sum_{e\in F}(y_e + x_ev).
\]
M\"{o}bius inversion gives
\[
Z(F)= \sum_{0\le G\le F}\mu(G,F)(y_e +  x_ev).
\]
