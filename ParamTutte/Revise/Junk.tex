In this note, we give common generalizations
for matroids of pertinent definitions and methods,
and prove the results. [$\leftarrow$REVISE]
but this application requires only those Tutte 
functions that are both {\bf strong} 
($T(M^1\oplus M^2)=T(M^1)T(M^2)$) and {\bf normal}
(have a corank-nullity generating function expression)
\cite{MR93a:05047}.  Additional progress is reported
in \cite{RelTuttePoly} where the functions
are called ``relative'' Tutte polynomials; and 
they have a very different application.
The Tutte functions we treat are those only required,
in addition to the parametrized additive identity,
to satisfy $T(M)=X_eT(M\setminus e)$ or
$T(M)=Y_eT(M\setminus e)$ for separators $e\not\in P$,
rather than $T(M^1\oplus M^2)=T(M^1)T(M^2)$.  
They are called {\bf separator-strong}\cite{JoAndTom}.
$E(M)$ denotes $S(M)\setminus P$, the
elements of $M$ not in $P$.
We present
two principal outcomes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
...
  The Tutte function
depends on $I(Q)$, the initial values on
minors $Q = $ $M/A\setminus (E\setminus A)$
$=$ $M/A|P$ which are called {\bf $P$-quotients},
in addition to the parameters.  The three known
\cite{MR93a:05047,BollobasRiordanTuttePolyColored,Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}
families
of polynomial conditions necessary and sufficient 
for the Tutte function to be well-defined 
are generalized to five; the two new ones involve
pairs $\{e,f\}\subseteq E$ connected to $P$.  

\end{enumerate}

The conditions, similar to ours, on the parameters 
only given in \cite{RelTuttePoly}
are necessary and sufficient
for the Tutte function to be well-defined
\emph{for all} choices of initial values $I(Q)$.
Our conditions are derived without
this universal quantification.  Hence a factor $I(Q)$
appears in each.  They reveal 
exactly which polynomials involving any $I(Q)$
must vanish depending on the structure of 
the family on which the Tutte function is
well-defined.  Also, our proof technique is
different; it generalizes that 
in \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}.
