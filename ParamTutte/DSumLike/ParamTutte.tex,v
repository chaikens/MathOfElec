\begin{abstract}
Tutte decompositions with deletion and contraction not done of elements
in a fixed set of ports $P$, and the 
resulting polynomial expressions and functions
for matroids, oriented matroids and labelled graphs are investigated.
We give conditions on parameters $x_e$, $y_e$, $X_e$, $Y_e$ for $e\not\in P$,
and on initial values $I(Q)$ for indecomposibles, that are necessary and 
sufficient for the following equations to have a well-defined solution:
$T(M)=X_e T(M/e)$ for coloops $e\not\in P$, 
$T(M)=Y_e T(M\setminus e)$ for loops $e\not\in P$, and
$T(M)=x_e T(M/e) + y_e T(M\setminus e)$ for other $e\not\in P$.   They
generalize similar conditions given by Bollob\'{o}s and Riordon, Zaslavsky,
and Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi for Tutte functions defined without the
$e\not\in P$ restriction.  We complete the generalization to matroids
given Diao and Hetyei which was motivated
by invariants for the virtual knots studied by Kauffman.  
Our motivations include electrical network analysis, oriented matroids,
and negative correlation of edge appearances in spanning trees; our $P$-ported
Tutte polynomials of oriented matroids express orientation information
that ordinary Tutte polynomials cannot.
We also apply the computation tree formalism of Gordon and McMahon to give
activities expansions for $P$-ported parametrized Tutte polynomials
that are more general than those
just determined by the linear element orderings
which originated in Tutte's dichromate.

The polynomials expressing conditions
for above Tutte equation to have a solution
all have one factor $I(Q_i)$.  Since the elements are 
labelled, the methodology also applies
to some other situations with ports including graphs with labelled vertices
for which similar theorems can be proven.  Examples also 
demonstrate cases situations where conditions similar these
polynomials 
are not sufficient for Tutte
equations to be solvable.

\section{Introduction}

The Tutte polynomial is a well-known invariant of graphs and matroids,
and various useful generalizations of its theory,
defined by attaching parameters to elements, have been found.
We generalize by restricting the Tutte equations
so that only the elements not in a fixed subset $P$
can be deleted and/or
contracted; see \eqref{TA} and \eqref{TSSM} below.
Our work is largely based on \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}, which
addresses parametrization in detail and which unifies the main 
results of Zaslavsky \cite{MR93a:05047} and 
Bollob\'{o}s and Riordan \cite{BollobasRiordanTuttePolyColored}.
Diao and Hetyei \cite{RelTuttePoly} give 
special cases of our generalization together with its
application to virtual knot invariants \cite{KauffmanVirtualKnots}.
Recent work on a different generalization, weak Tutte functions
(see sec. \ref{Complications}), has been done by 
Ellis-Monaghan and Zaslavsky \cite{ZaslavskyOct18}.

The separator-strong Tutte equations
\eqref{TA}, \eqref{TSSM}
equations reduce to the well-known identities for the 
two-variable Tutte polynomial
when the parameters are $x_e=y_e=1$, $X_e=x$ and $Y_e=y$ for all $e$ and 
the set $P=\emptyset$.
In other words, we study the effects of distinguishing
certain elements, those in $P$, so they are never deleted or 
contracted in the course of Tutte decompositions
that carry the $x_e$, $y_e$, $X_e$, $Y_e$ parameters
into the resulting polynomials.
We generalize 
some basic theorems about parametrized Tutte functions and
about Tutte polynomials, both of matroids and of graphs, to this situation.

We call $P$ the
\emph{set of ports}.  The resulting Tutte polynomials or functions
have been called \emph{set-pointed} \cite{SetPointedLV,SetPointedLV1}, 
\emph{ported} \cite{sdcPorted,TutteEx} and 
\emph{relative} \cite{RelTuttePoly}.  
We prefer the terms ``port'' and ``$P$-ported equations
or functions'' because of our applications
\cite{sdcOMP,TutteEx} and because 
the $P$ can be specified.


When parameters $x_e$ and $y_e$ are introduced into the 
additive Tutte equation, the route toward generalizations
of the Tutte polynomial becomes complicated.  The next subsection 
(\ref{Complications})
elaborates on the particular 
destination---\emph{separator-strong Tutte functions},
to which we add the port restrictions.
Here is the main definition with the
restriction for $P$:

\begin{definition}
Let $P$ be a set and $\mathcal{C}$ be a class of matroids or
oriented matroids closed under taking minors or oriented minors
by, for $e\not\in P$, deleting $e$ if $e$ is not a coloop or
contracting $e$ if $e$ is not a loop.
Such a $\mathcal{C}$ is called a $P$-family.  $\mathcal{C}$ is
given with four parameters in a commutative ring $R$,
$(x_e,y_e,X_e,Y_e)$, for each $e\not\in P$ that is an element
in some $M\in\mathcal{C}$.

A separator-strong $P$-ported Tutte function 
$T$ maps $\mathcal{C}$ to $R$ or to an $R$-module and satisfies 
conditions 
\eqref{TA} and \eqref{TSSM} below for all $M\in\mathcal{C}$ and
all $e$ in $M$.


\begin{equation}
\label{TA}
\tag{TA}
\begin{gathered}
T(M) = x_e T(M/e) + y_e T(M\setminus e) \\
\text{ if $e\not\in P$ and $e$ is a non-separator, 
       i.e., neither a loop nor a coloop.}
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
\label{TSSM}
\tag{TSSM}
\begin{gathered}
\text{If } e\not\in P\text{ is a coloop in }M\text{ then }
T(M)=X_e T(M/e).\\
\text{If } e\not\in P\text{ is a loop in }M\text{ then }
T(M)=Y_e T(M\setminus e).
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

The $M\in \mathcal{C}$ for which neither \eqref{TA} nor
\eqref{TSSM} apply are called \emph{indecomposibles} and
the \emph{$P$-quotients} in $\mathcal{C}$. The analogous
definitions are used for graphs and directed graphs.

\end{definition}

Except in remarks about peripheral work, all Tutte polynomials,
functions and equations in this paper refer to the 
separator-strong kind, except
when they are qualified to be strong (see \ref{TSM} and sec. 
\ref{DirectSec}-\ref{GraphSec}).

Evidently, \eqref{TA} and \eqref{TSSM} 
specify how $T(M)$ can be recursively calculated from
the values of $T$ on indecomposibles.
The definition that $T$ is a function 
means that
all calculations of $T(M)$ for $M\in\mathcal{C}$
using \eqref{TA} and \eqref{TSSM} yield the same result.
A simple induction on $|E(M)|$,
the number of elements in $M$ that are not in $P$, 
shows that if a Tutte function
with specified values on the indecomposible matroids or oriented matriods
exists for the given $P$-family and parameters, then the function
is unique.  

Restricting Tutte decomposition operations to $e\not\in P$
gives some new information about oriented matroids and
oriented (i.e., directed) graphs.
The fundamental consequence of the restriction 
is that the indecomposible matroids (or graphs) 
are minors of $M$ that have all their 
elements (or edges) in $P$.  We will therefore also call them
$P$-quotients.
If $M$ is an oriented
matroid, each indecomposible is an oriented
matroid because the oriented minor $M/A\setminus B$
is well-defined when $A,B$ partitions $E$.
Hence, when $P\neq \emptyset$, $P$-ported Tutte functions
can have different values on different orientations of the
same orientable matroid.  On the other hand, we can
define Tutte functions of matroids obtained by 
forgetting the orientations of oriented matroids.  
Many of our results will be stated for ``matroids or
oriented matroids'' because there are different indecomposibles
and Tutte functions depending on whether or 
not the matroids carry an orientation.  Analogous
statements of course apply to graphs and directed graphs.

We presented in  \cite{TutteEx}
a new kind of strong Tutte-like function on $P$-ported oriented graphic
matroids (more generally, unimodular, i.e. regular oriented matroids)
where the values vary with the orientation.   
Each function value $F(G)$ is
in the exterior algebra over $R^{2p}$, where $R$ is
the real polynomial fraction field with the $x_e, y_e$ parameters as 
variables, and $|P|=p$.  So formulated, the function
obeys an \emph{anti-commutative} variant of \eqref{TSM} below
with exterior multiplication $\wedge$.  
(When $P=\emptyset$, the function reduces 
to the reduced Laplacian determinant in the
famous Matrix Tree Theorem \cite{HararyBook,sdcMTT}.)  
It is the first example we know
of
``the possibility of making use of a noncommutative generalization of the Tutte
polynomial at some point in the future.'' mentioned by Bollob\'{o}s and
Riordan in \cite{BollobasRiordanTuttePolyColored}.  We won't say
more beyond that each of the $\binom{2p}{p}$
Pl\"{u}cker coodinates of $F(G)$ is a $P$-ported Tutte function
of the kind we cover here.

\subsection{Complications from Parametrization}
\label{Complications}
It is known that,  even when $P=\emptyset$,
\eqref{TA} fails to have a solution
$T$ except if certain algebraic relations are true 
about the parameters and
the so-called initial values of $T$.  

%All such relations are true when
%$x_e=y_e=1$.

%The initial values are prescribed 
%for the empty matroid or edgeless graphs, and on each loop and coloop.

For example, if $M=U_{1}^{ef}$ is  ${e,f}$ in parallel, then
applying \eqref{TA} for $e$ gives the polynomial
($U^e_0$, $U^e_1$ are the loop, coloop matroids on $\{e\}$, etc.)
\[x_e T(U_0^f) + y_e T(U_1^f)\]
 whence applying it for $f$ gives 
\[x_f T(U_0^e) + y_f T(U_1^e).\]  
These are different polynomials in the parameters and initial values.  
The equation that says they are equal is an example of a relation that 
is necessary for a solution to exist.  
The example demonstrates that when the Tutte identities are 
parametrized, it is important to carefully distinguish 
between a solution value $T(M)$, where a solution $T$ 
is a function  that
satisfies all the relevent identities, and a formal polynomial  that
results from using a subset of the identities to calculate
$T(M)$ for one $M$.  We will in section \ref{Activity} investigate
using  \emph{Tutte computation tree} \cite{GordonMcMachonGreedoid} 
to express the activities expansions for all
such polynomials obtained by recursion, with any port set $P$.

Generally speaking, given a system of equations that, like Tutte equations,
specifies a function value $T(M)$ with recursive reductions,
for the system to ``have a solution''
means that all recursive calculations of $T(M)$ from the equations have the 
same result.  We then say that $T(M)$ is \emph{well-defined}.  The above
example shows calculations of two different polynomials
in the parameters and initial values.
For this reason, we follow \cite{MR93a:05047,Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}
and use the term 
``Tutte function'' for a solution to (separator-strong) 
Tutte identities, rather 
than Tutte polynomial.  The term ``Tutte polynomial'' is reserved
for certain polynomial expressions that  equal the Tutte function
value if additional conditions are satisfied.  
We follow \cite{BollobasRiordanTuttePolyColored,Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}
to say $T(M)$ is well-defined when the parameters are in 
ring $R$ and the initial values are in
$R$ or an $R$-module for which the polynomial expressions for $T(M)$ 
obtained by all the recursive applications of the relevant
Tutte equations are equal.
The conditions are conveniently expressed as generators 
for the ideal $I$ such that the universal Tutte function is into
a quotient ring or module modulo $I$.
See Corollary \ref{UniversalCor}.

Besides \eqref{TA}, classical Tutte polynomials and other 
so-called \emph{strong Tutte
functions} \cite{MR93a:05047} satisfy the multiplicative identity
\begin{equation}
\tag{TSM}
\label{TSM}
T(M_1\oplus M_2)=T(M_1)T(M_2).
\end{equation}
Confusion between Tutte polynomials and Tutte functions arises
because the classical two-variable Tutte polynomial in $x, y$ expresses
a strong, non-parametrized Tutte function for every assignment
of values to $x$ and $y$. 

Different combinations of variations of Tutte equations determine
different kinds of Tutte functions.  For example, the additive 
identity \eqref{TA} alone (with $P=\emptyset$) characterizes
\emph{weak Tutte functions} \cite{MR93a:05047,ZaslavskyOct18}.

Our generalization is the kind of Tutte function determined by 
\eqref{TA} and \eqref{TSSM}; the latter is the weakening of \eqref{TSM} 
so it applies only for cases where one of $M_1$ or $M_2$ is a 
\emph{separator}, that is, a loop or coloop.  
We generalize by adding the restriction on 
port elements.
The result, Theorem \ref{BigTheorem} (sec. \ref{ParamTutteSec}), is a 
a straightforward
generalization of Theorem \ref{ZBRmatroids}
below paraphrased from 
\cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}
about the existance and universal form for 
the family of Tutte functions characterized by \eqref{TA} and \eqref{TSSM}.
This family was subsequently
named \emph{separator-strong Tutte functions} by \cite{JoAndTom}
because it is wider than the strong Tutte functions characterized
by \eqref{TA} and \eqref{TSM}, which are the subject of 
\cite{MR93a:05047}.  We follow these authors' terminology when we extend the
family to matroids, oriented matroids and graphs with distinguished 
port elements, and then to ported objects 
representing  matroids or oriented matroids.
The conclusions for $P$-ported parametrized
strong Tutte functions easily follow from those for the separator-strong ones.
See \ref{StrongTheorem} in sec. \ref{DirectSec}.

We build upon \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi} which reconciles
the results of \cite{MR93a:05047} and 
\cite{BollobasRiordanTuttePolyColored} with a common generalization.  
It generalizes the fields and strong Tutte functions of \cite{MR93a:05047}
to the commutative rings and separator-strong Tutte functions of 
\cite{BollobasRiordanTuttePolyColored}, and the definedness on 
all matroids in \cite{BollobasRiordanTuttePolyColored} to definedness
on a minor-closed class in \cite{MR93a:05047}.  Further, neither the
matroid or graph Tutte functions need to be 
$0$ or $1$ on $\emptyset$.
A main result of \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi} is called the
Zaslavsky-Bollob\'{o}s-Riordan (ZBR) theorem for matroids:
\begin{thm}
%(The generalized Zaslavsky-Bollob\'{a}s-Riordan theorem for matroids) 
\label{ZBRmatroids}
Let R
be a commutative ring, let $\mathcal{C}$ be a minor-closed class of matroids 
defined on subsets of an $R$-parametrized class $U$, and let 
$\alpha\in R$. 
Then there is a parametrized Tutte polynomial on
$\mathcal{C}$
with $T(\emptyset)=\alpha$ if and only if the following identities are 
satisfied.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a]
Whenever $e$ and $f$ are digonal in $M\in\mathcal{C}$ 
(i.e., they constitute a two element circuit),
\[
\alpha\cdot(x_e Y_f + y_e X_f) = \alpha\cdot (x_f Y_e + y_f X_e ).
\]
\item[b]
Whenever $e$, $f$ and $g$ are triangular in $M\in\mathcal{C}$ 
(i.e. they constitute a three element circuit),
\[
\alpha\cdot  X_g\cdot (x_e Y_f + y_e x_f) = 
\alpha\cdot  X_g\cdot (Y_e x_f + x_e y_f ).
\]
\item[c]
Whenever $e$, $f$ and $g$ are triadic in $M\in\mathcal{C}$ 
(i.e. they constitute a three element cocircuit),
\[
\alpha\cdot Y_g\cdot  (x_e Y_f + y_e x_f) = 
\alpha\cdot Y_g \cdot (Y_e x_f + x_e y_g ).
\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

The terminology ``$R$-parametrized class $U$'' (of matroid elements)
was used in \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi} to emphasize that the parameters
$(x_e,y_e,X_e,Y_e)$ are attached to elements $e$, not equations.  
The assumption that $\mathcal{C}$ is minor-closed implies that the 
three conditions can be restricted to the pair or triple being the
only elements in $M$.  Our generalization, Theorem \ref{BigTheorem} 
(sec. \ref{ParamTutteSec})
is expressed that way.

The 
one indecomposible for the ZBR theorem is the empty matroid
$\emptyset$.   Loop or coloop matroids on $e$ are 
decomposible; the values of the Tutte function on them equal
respectively $Y_e T(\emptyset)$ and $X_e T(\emptyset)$.   


\subsection{Summary}

We first generalize to $P$-ported matroids and oriented matroids the 
Bollob\'{a}s-Riordan-Zaslavsky theorem as synthesized
by Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi in \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}.  
Parameters are only attached to $e\not\in P$.

In our
generalization of Theorem \ref{ZBRmatroids}, it is easy to see that the 
indecomposibles are those matroids $Q_i$ in $\mathcal{C}$
whose ground set $S(Q_i)\subseteq P$.
When $P\neq\emptyset$,
instead of every monomial resulting from a Tutte decomposition
containing the factor $T(\emptyset)$, every monomial resulting 
from a Tutte decomposition of $M$ contains a factor $T(Q_i)$ where $Q_i$
is some minor of $M$ obtained by contracting or deleting every $e\not\in P$.
These 
\emph{initial} 
values must be given for those $Q_i$ in order
to define a particular Tutte function.  They generalize the
$\alpha=T(\emptyset)$ value.

Our generalization of the ZBR theorem 
first replaces $T(\emptyset)=\alpha$ in its three
equations with $I(Q_i)$.
It also adds two more equations pertaining to $M\in\mathcal{C}$
in which series and parallel pairs $\{e,f\}$, $e\not\in P$, $f\not\in P$
are connected to one or more elements of $P$.  Again, only
one $Q_i$ appears in each equation.  See Theorem \ref{BigTheorem}.
We let some Tutte functions take values in modules
to facilitate both defining universal Tutte functions with
quotient modules and
expressing formulas for Tutte functions of direct sums and
related combinations.

An interesting consequence is that no relationships are required
between $T(Q_i)$ and $T(Q_j)$ for different indecomposibles $Q_i$ and
$Q_j$ for the Tutte function to be well-defined.  This answers a 
question we raised in \cite{TutteEx}.

Second, we
extend to $P\ne \emptyset$ the activities Tutte polynomial
expressions and
corresponding interval partitions of the Boolean lattice
$2^{S(M)\setminus P}$.  Like the activities
expressions given by \cite{GordonMcMachonGreedoid}
for greedoid Tutte polynomials, the
expressions we present are not just those obtained when a fixed linear
ordering on the elements is used to determine for which element $e$ to
apply \eqref{TA} when two or more elements are eligible.
Each of our activities expressions is based on a formal (Tutte)
\emph{computation tree} as defined in \cite{GordonMcMachonGreedoid}.  

Third, we describe the relationship between the relevant 
separator-strong Tutte function
values when a matroid is a direct sum.  It is more complicated than
the product formula $T(M^1\oplus M^2)T(\emptyset)$ $=$ $T(M^1)T(M^2)$
for matroids and related formulas for graphs \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}
because a $P$-ported Tutte function value can involve more than one
indecomposible.  When the 
module that contains the universal Tutte polynomials is extended
to an algebra by defining direct sum and similar compositions of 
indecomposibles by the new algebra's multiplication $*$, the 
relationship can be expressed by $T(M^1\oplus M^2) = T(M^1)*T(M^2)$.
Families of objects with matroids, were deletion and contraction
is consistant with the matroids and restricted to $e\not\in P$,
are introduced to facilitate studying $P$-ported strong Tutte
functions of graphs. 

Finally, we specialize to graphs and so extend some of the graph
results of \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}.  Additional hypotheses
are given for $P$-ported Tutte functions of graphs, including
those with labelled vertices, for characterizations like
Theorems \ref{ZBRmatroids} and \ref{BigTheorem} to be true.

\subsection{Background and Other Related Work}

The topic of Tutte decomposition restricted so some elements
are not deleted or contracted probably made its first appearance in the
early work of Thomas Brylawski\cite{BrylawskiPointed}.  He formulated
a Tutte polynomial for ``pregeometries with basepoint $p_0$'' 
with the four variables $z$, $x$, $z'$ and $x'$.   His polynomial
is obtained from \eqref{PAE} in sec. \ref{Activity}
with the substitutions $P=\{p_0\}$,
$x_e=y_e=1$, $X_e = z$, $Y_e=x$ for all $e\neq p_0$, and
$[U^{p_0}_1]=z'$ and $[U^{p_0}_0]=x'$.  Another early appearance 
is \cite{SmithPatroids}.

Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}
explain that by leaving the reduction
by $e_0$ to last so $e_0$ is always contracted as a coloop or deleted
as a loop, the Tutte function value can be expressed by
$T(M) = (rX_{e_o} + sY_{e_0})T(\emptyset)$ were $r, s$ are 
not-necessarilly-unique elements in $R$.  As one application,
they 
give a formula for the parametrized Tutte polynomial
for the parallel connection across $e_0$
which generalized Brylawski's work.
These $r,s$ appear in
the $P$-ported Tutte function expression 
$rT(U^{e_0}_1)$ $+$ $sT(U^{e_0}_0)$ when $P=\{e_0\}$.  They
are parametrized generalizations of the coefficients of
$z'$ and $x'$ in Brylawski's four variable Tutte polynomial.

Las Vergnas defined and gave basic properties of ``set-pointed'' Tutte
polynomials (with no parameters) and used them to study matroid perspectives.
The polynomial given in \cite{MR0419272,SetPointedLV} has a variable
$\xi_l$ for each subset in a collection of $k$ subsets
$P_l\subseteq P$, $l=1,\ldots,k$.  Each term in \eqref{PAE} had
$\prod\xi_l^{r_i(P_l)}$ for $[Q_i]$ where $r_i$ is the rank function 
for $Q_i$.  Therefore \eqref{TSM} was satisfied and the association of the
term to (non-oriented) matroid $Q_i$ could be assured by taking all
$2^{|P|}$ subsets for the $P_l$.  The matroid perspective is the 
strong map $M\setminus E(M)\rightarrow M/E(M)$ given by the identity on
$P$.  



In \cite{sdcPorted}, we
reproduced Las Vergnes' theory with explicit $P$-quotient (matroid)
variables (see the $[Q_i]$ symbols in Corollary \ref{UniversalCor}
in sec. \ref{UniversalSec}) in place of 
$\prod\xi_l^{r_i(P_l)}$.  We then
gave formulas for the $P$-ported Tutte polynomial for the
union and its dual of matroids whose common elements are in $P$.
These formulas  work in a way similar to what appears in
sec. \ref{UniversalSec}.
We extend to algebras
the $\mathbb{Z}[u,w]$-module
generated by the $[Q_i]$ by defining multiplications 
$\tilde{*}$ with the rules
$[Q_i]\tilde{*}[Q_j]=r_{ij}[Q_{i,j}]$, with $r_{i,j}\in\mathbb{Z}[u,w]$ and
$Q_{i,j}=Q_i*Q_j$ depending on $(Q_i,Q_j)$ and whether $*$ represents 
union or its dual.  It is not often recognized that series and parallel
connection of matroids across basepoint $p$ 
is equivalent to matroid union and its dual on matroids with only
element $p$ in common.  We plan to investigate whether the formulas
for parametrized Tutte polynomials of parallel connections
in \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi} can be generalized to the dual
of union when $|P|>1$, and to detail the relationship when $|P|=1$.


We introduced $P$-ported parametrized Tutte polynomial 
for normal Tutte functions
in \cite{TutteEx}.
Most of the results in the current paper, when restricted to
\textit{normal} $P$-ported parametrized Tutte functions (those with
corank-nullity polynomial expressions), appeared in \cite{TutteEx}
or can be derived by adding parameters and oriented matriod considerations
to material in \cite{sdcPorted}.  
These include computation tree\cite{GordonMcMachonGreedoid} based activities 
expansions 
with terms corresponding to $P$-subbases (which are called
``contracting sets'' in \cite{RelTuttePoly}).
%The one non-elementary fact about
%oriented matroids needed is that two subsets $B,B'\in E(M)$ that span
%the same flat define the same $\emph{oriented}$ minor
%$M/B|P=M/B'|P$.  See \cite{OMBOOK}.  
In the normal case, the indecomposibles can be assigned arbitrarilly.
We used this to show the our extensor-valued Tutte-like function 
\cite{sdcPorted} is expressible
by assigning extensors as the initial values.  In this
electrical network application, the indecomposibles are oriented matroids
and different values \emph{are} assigned to different orientations of
the same underlying matroid.  

We had left open questions about
when non-normal $P$-ported parametrized Tutte
functions are well-defined.  They are 
whether arbitrary
values can be assigned to the indecomposibles and what is
the appropriate generalization of
conditions on the parameters given by Zaslavsky \cite{MR93a:05047},
Bollob\'{a}s and Riordan \cite{BollobasRiordanTuttePolyColored} and 
Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}.
Theorem \ref{BigTheorem} resolves these questions:  The new conditions 
are obvious revisions of those for $P=\emptyset$.  The indecomposibles
can be assigned arbitrarilly so long as for each one separately,
the conditions of Theorem \ref{BigTheorem} are satisfied.  In addition,
if the function is to be strong, Theorem \ref{StrongTheorem}
tells us that it is sufficient for the assignment to
indecomposibles be strong.


Diao and Hetyei gave conditions on the parameters, similar to ours, for the
Tutte polynomial to be well-defined for every assignment of
values on the indecomposibles that obeys a symmetry condition.
That condition is motivated by the graph specialization.  
They gave the very natural application to invariants of 
virtual knots calculated
from their diagrams.
Zero edges (what we call port edges) correspond to the 
virtual crossings, and the sign parameters of the other 
$\pm 1$ edges derive from left-over or right-over
sense of the regular crossings.  Their preprint in fact motivated
us to pursue the current topic\cite{RelTuttePoly}.  This topic
leads us to ask if the $P$-ported objects with matroids abstraction, 
and its related Tutte computation tree expansions for parametrized
Tutte functions (sec. \ref{DirectSec}), can be usefully
applied to objects besides graphs or directed graphs, such
as various kinds of knot diagrams.

Another open project is to classify the solutions to
the conditions of Theorem \ref{BigTheorem} (about separator-strong
$P$-ported Tutte functions) and 
Theorem  \ref{StrongTheorem} (about the strong ones) for rings and
for fields along the lines of 
\cite{MR93a:05047} and \cite{BollobasRiordanTuttePolyColored}.

\section{Preliminaries}

For a matroid or oriented matroid $M$, the
ground set is denoted by $S(M)$ and the rank function 
is denoted by $r$.  Given
a set $P$, $S(M)\setminus P=\{e\in S(M) \mid e\not\in P\}$ 
is denoted by $E(M)$.  
The elements of $P$ %in this context 
are
called \emph{ports}, and a matroid or oriented matroid
given with a set of ports $P$ is be called
\emph{$P$-ported.}  Analogous terminology is used with graphs or 
directed graphs; then, the edges are the elements.

A $P$-\emph{family} is a collection $\mathcal{C}$ 
of matroids or oriented matroids such that
given $M\in \mathcal{C}$ and $e\in E(M)$, 
the contraction $M/e\in\mathcal{C}$ if $e$ is not a loop in
$M$ and the deletion $M\setminus e\in\mathcal{C}$ if 
$e$ is  not a coloop in $M$.  
The set of non-port elements that occur in $\mathcal{C}$ is denoted
by $E(\mathcal{C})$.  Specifically 
$E(\mathcal{C})=\{e\mid e\in E(M)$ for some $M\in\mathcal{C}\}$.
It is straightforward to extend these definitions to families of
objects, such as graphs, where each member object has an associated matroid
on appropriate elements of the object, such as edges, and those elements
can be deleted and/or contracted consistantly with the matroid.

All the minors of $M$ obtained
by deleting or contracting zero or more non-port elements are called
$P$-minors.  Thus, a $P$-family is 
a $P$-minor closed collection of matroids or oriented matroids.
The $P$-minors $Q_i$ for which $S(Q_i)\subseteq P$,
i.e., those with no non-port elements, are called the $P$-quotients
of $M$.  We say a $P$-quotient belongs to $\mathcal{C}$ if it is a
$P$-quotient of some $M\in\mathcal{C}$.  Note that if $P$ is finite,
(and the objects are just matroids or oriented matroids)
there are only a finite number of $P$-quotients because there are 
only a finite number of matroids or oriented matroids over subsets
of $P$.

As usual, a \emph{separator} is an element that is a loop,  or is
a coloop, i.e., an isthmus in a graph.


Let $R$ be a commutative ring with multiplicative and additive
identities $1$ and $0$ respectively.
We sometimes assume that a $P$-family $\mathcal{C}$ comes equipped
with four parameters $x_e,y_e,X_e,Y_e\in R$ for each 
$e\in E(\mathcal{C})$ and one initial value $I(Q_i)\in R$ 
or in an $R$-module for
each $P$-quotient $Q_i$ in $\mathcal{C}$.
Note that whether or
not the empty matroid $\emptyset$ is a $P$-quotient depends on
$\mathcal{C}$.  For example, if $M\in\mathcal{C}$ with
$S(M)\cap P=\emptyset$ then $\emptyset$ certainly is a $P$-quotient.
In that case, \eqref{TSSM} specifies that $T(M) = X_e I(\emptyset)$
or $T(M) =Y_e I(\emptyset)$ if $e\not\in P$ is a separator.
Therefore,
we consider the $X_e$ and $Y_e$ to be parameters
because $X_e$ and $Y_e$ are values of the Tutte function
only if $\emptyset\in \mathcal{C}$ and $I(\emptyset)=1$.
The Tutte equations \eqref{TA} and \eqref{TSSM}
justify calling the $P$-quotients indecomposibles.

The uniform matroid with elements $\{e, f, \cdots \}$ and rank $r$ is denoted
by $U^{ef\cdots}_r$.

In the remainder, we consider only elements $e, f, g$ none of 
which are in $P$.

Two distinct elements $e,f$ in matroid $M$
are \emph{parallel} when
every cocircuit that contains one of them also contains the other.  This
is equivalent to $\{e, f\}$ being a two-element circuit.
They are \emph{series} when every circuit that contains one of them
also contains the other.  This is equivalent to $\{e, f\}$ being a two-element
cocircuit.
They are called a \emph{dyad} when 
they are both parallel and series.  Note that every dyad is a connected
component of $M$.

Two distinct elements $\{e,f\}$  are a \emph{parallel pair connected
to $P$} when they are parallel and there is a cocircuit of the form
$\{e,f\}\cup P'$ with $\emptyset\neq P'\subseteq P$.

Two distinct elements $e,f$ are a \emph{series pair connected
to $P$} when they are series and there is a circuit of the form
$\{e,f\}\cup P'$ with $\emptyset\neq P'\subseteq P$.

Three distinct elements $e,f,g$ are called a \emph{triangle}
when they comprise a 3 element circuit $U_2^{efg}$ that is a 
connected component of $M$.

Three distinct elements $e,f,g$ are called a \emph{triad}
when they comprise a 3 element cocircuit $U_1^{ef}$ that is a 
connected component of $M$.

The following is critical to the proof that the generalizations
of identities in Theorem \ref{ZBRmatroids} all have the form
$I(Q_i)\cdot r=0$ where $r$ is a polynomial in the $x_e,y_e,X_e,Y_e$
parameters and $Q_i$ is one $P$-quotient.

\begin{prop}
\label{SameMinorProp}
Suppose $e,f$ are in series, or are in parallel, in matroid or
oriented matroid $M$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The minors $M/e\setminus f=M/f\setminus e$
are equal as matroids.
\item If $M$ is oriented, the oriented minors 
$M/e\setminus f=M/f\setminus e$ are equal as oriented matroids.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
In the following, take all matroids as oriented or not
depending on how $M$ is given.

If $e,f$ are in series, note that $M/e\setminus f$ $=$
$M\setminus f/e$.  $e$ is a coloop in $M\setminus f$,
so $M\setminus f/e$ $=$ $M\setminus\{e,f\}$, which is
clearly the same matroid or oriented matroid if $e,f$
are interchanged.  The relevant theory for oriented matroids
can be found in XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX of \cite{OMBOOK}.

If $e,f$ are in parallel, $e,f$ are in series in 
the matroid or oriented matroid dual $M^*$ of $M$.
By the first case, $M^*\setminus e/ f$ $=$
$M^*\setminus f/e$ as matroids or as oriented matroids.
Thus $M/e\setminus f$ $=$ $(M^*\setminus e/ f)^*$ $=$
$(M^*\setminus f/ e)^*$ $=$ $M/f\setminus e$ as matroids or
as oriented matroids.
\end{proof}

\section{Parametrized Ported Tutte Functions}
\label{ParamTutteSec}
Let $P$ be a set and $\mathcal{C}$ be a $P$-family of matroids or oriented
matroids.  In this section, we state, discuss and prove this
generalization of Theorem \ref{ZBRmatroids} of \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}:

\begin{thm}
\label{BigTheorem}
The following two statements are equivalent.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $T$ from $\mathcal{C}$ to $R$ or an $R$-module is a $P$-ported 
separator-strong parametrized
Tutte function with $R$-parameters $(x, y, X, Y)$ whose values 
$T(Q_i)$ on $P$-quotients $Q_i\in\mathcal{C}$ are the initial
values $I(Q_i)$.
\item
\begin{enumerate}
\item For every $M=U^{ef}_1\oplus Q_j\in\mathcal{C}$ with 
$P$-quotient $Q_j$ ($U^{ef}_1$ is a dyad), 
\[
I(Q_j)(x_e Y_f + y_e X_f) = 
I(Q_j)(x_f Y_e + y_f X_e).
\]
\item
For every $M=U^{efg}_2\oplus Q_j\in\mathcal{C}$ with 
$P$-quotient $Q_j$ ($U^{efg}_2$ is a triangle), 
\[
I(Q_j)X_g(x_e y_f + y_e X_f) = 
I(Q_j)X_g(x_f y_e + y_f X_e).
\]
\item
For every $M=U^{efg}_1\oplus Q_j\in\mathcal{C}$ with 
$P$-quotient $Q_j$  ($U^{efg}_1$ is a triad), 
\[
I(Q_j)Y_g(x_e Y_f + y_e x_f) = 
I(Q_j)Y_g(x_f Y_e + y_f x_e).
\]
\item
If $\{e,f\}=E(M)$ is a parallel pair connected to $P$, 
\[
I(Q_j)(x_e Y_f + y_e x_f) = 
I(Q_j)(x_f Y_e + y_f x_e)
\]
where $P$-quotient $Q_j=M/e\setminus f=M/f\setminus e$.
\item
If $\{e,f\}=E(M)$ is a series pair connected to $P$, 
\[
I(Q_j)(x_e y_f + y_e X_f) = 
I(Q_j)(x_f y_e + y_f X_e)
\]
where $P$-quotient $Q_j=M/e\setminus f=M/f\setminus e$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\subsection{Remarks}
Proposition \ref{SameMinorProp} assures that the different 
expressions for $P$-quotients $Q_i$ in Theorem \ref{BigTheorem} 
are in fact equal as matroid or as oriented matroids, depending
on how $M$ was given.  

The first three cases are trivial extensions of 
the conditions in Theorem \ref{ZBRmatroids} \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}.  
The only difference
is that our conditions have the factor $I(Q_j)$ 
in place of $\alpha=T(\emptyset)$.
Just two new conditions are required by $P\neq\emptyset$.  They
are vacuous when $P=\emptyset$.

Our proof is the immediate result of adding considerations of ports to the
proof in \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}, there described
as ``a straightforward adaption of the proof of Theorem 3.3 of 
\cite{MR93a:05047}.''

The idea is to use induction on $n=|E(M)|$ rather than on $|S(M)|$.
As in \cite{MR93a:05047,BollobasRiordanTuttePolyColored,Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi},
the necessity of each condition is verified for families of examples with 
$n=2$ and $3$, where the family members correspond to different $P$-quotients
and different choices of $e$, $f$ and $g$.
When $P=\emptyset$, the only $P$-quotient is $\emptyset$.


As in 
\cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi},
we rely on the hypothesis the $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under our
$P$-minors 
in order to verify
(1) that the conditions imply $T(M)$ is well-defined for $n=0, 1$ and $2$
and (2) that in a larger minimum $n$ counterexample, the elements of
$E(M)$ are either all in series or all in parallel, 
and then the conditions
imply that all calculation orders give the same result.  All the cases involve
two different combinations of deleting and contracting of several elements
in $E(M)$ where both combinations produce the same $P$-quotients.

The empty matroid
$\emptyset$ is clearly the only indecomposible for the
separator strong Tutte identities with $P=\emptyset$.  
Then $\emptyset\in\mathcal{C}$ is required,
provided $\mathcal{C}\neq \emptyset$.
When we generalize to the
$P$-ported separator strong Tutte identities
with $P\neq\emptyset$, the indecomposibles
depend on $\mathcal{C}$ and  $\emptyset\not\in\mathcal{C}$ is possible.  

\subsection{Proof}
We sketch the proof with a few details, pointing out differences from
\cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}.

As in \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}, 
the necessary relations are easy to deduce by 
applying \eqref{TA} and \eqref{TSSM}
to the particular
matroids or oriented matroids of $\mathcal{C}$ to which they apply.
Now on to the converse.

Let $M\in\mathcal{C}$ be a counterexample with minimum $n=|E(M)|$.
Therefore, whenever $M'$ is a proper $P$-minor of $M$,
$T(M')$ is well-defined.  The Tutte conditions \eqref{TA} and \eqref{TSSM}
have the property that given $M$ and $e\in M$, exactly one equation
applies.  Therefore, the induction hypothesis entails that
calculations that yield different values for $T(M)$ must start with
reducing by different elements of $E(M)$.  Since $T(M)$ is given 
unambiguously by the initial value $I(M)$ when $n=0$, we can assume
$n\geq 2$.

$M$ cannot contain a separator $e\in E(M)$.  This is a consequence of the
fact, applied to $P$-minors, that 
a separator $e\in E(M)$ is a separator in every minor of $M$ containing $e$.
Therefore, as observed in \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}, every
computation has the same result $X_e T(M/e)$ or $Y_e T(M\setminus e)$ 
depending
on whether $e$ is a coloop or a loop.

Let $e$ be one element in $E(M)$.  Since no element in $E(M)$ is a 
separator, $V=x_{e} T(M/{e}) + y_{e} T(M\setminus {e})$ is well-defined, 
and so is $x_{e'} T(M/{e'}) + y_{e'} T(M\setminus {e'})$ 
for each other $e'\in E$.
We follow \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi} and define
$D=\{e\in E(M) \mid V=x_{e} T(M/{e}) + y_{e} T(M\setminus {e})\}$.  The 
induction
hypothesis then tells us 
that there is at least 
one element $f\in E(M)\setminus D$.  
(Our notation means of course that $e, e', f\not\in P$.)

Suppose that $e$ is a separator in both $M\setminus f$ and 
$M/f$ and $f$ is a separator in both 
$M\setminus e$ and $M/e$.  Then, 
$T$ would
be well-defined for all four of these $P$-minors and so
we can write 
\[
T(M)=x_e x_f T(M/\{e,f\}) + x_e y_f T(M/e\setminus f)
+ y_e x_f T(M\setminus e/f)
+ y_e y_f T(M\setminus\{e,f\}).
\]
Both computations give the same value because in this situation
the reductions by $e$ and $f$ commute.  
So, for $M$ to be a counterexample, there must be $e\in D$
and $f\not\in D$ ($e, f\not\in P$)
to which
one of the following two lemmas apply: 

\begin{lem}
\cite{MR93a:05047}
Let $e , f$ be nonseparators in a matroid $M$. The following
statements are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
$e$ is a separator in $M\setminus f$.
\item
$e$ is a coloop in $M\setminus f$.
\item
$e$ and $f$ are in series in $M$.
\item
$f$ is a separator in $M\setminus e$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lem}

\begin{lem}
\cite{MR93a:05047}
Let $e , f$ be nonseparators in a matroid $M$. The following
statements are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
$e$ is a separator in $M/ f$.
\item
$e$ is a loop in $M/ f$.
\item
$e$ and $f$ are in parallel in $M$.
\item
$f$  is a separator in $M/e$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lem}

We claim that one of the following five cases must be satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
$n=2$ and $E(M)=\{e,f\}$ is a dyad.
\item
$n\geq 3$ and $E(M)$ is a circuit not connected to $P$.
\item
$n\geq 3$ and $E(M)$ is a cocircut not connected to $P$.
\item
$n\geq 2$ and for some $\emptyset\neq P'\subseteq P$,
$P'\cup E(M)$ is a circuit.
\item
$n\geq 2$ and for some $\emptyset\neq P'\subseteq P$,
$P'\cup E(M)$ is a cocircuit.
\end{enumerate}



As in  \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}, we draw the conclusion that
if $e\in D$ and $f\not\in D$ then $e, f$ are either series or parallel. 
It was further proven that a series pair and a parallel pair cannot
have exactly one element in common.  Therefore, the pairs $e,f$ satisfying 
the conditions are either all series pairs or all parallel pairs.  By 
minimality of $n$, $E(M)$ is either an $n$-element parallel class or an 
$n$-element series class.  The last two cases are distinguished from
the first three according to whether or not $E(M)$ is disconnected or not
from elements of $P$ in matroid $M$.  We now use \eqref{TA} and \eqref{TSSM}
to show that, in each case, the calculations that start with $e$ and 
those that start with $f$
have the same result, which contradicts $e\in D$ and $f\not\in D$.

We give the details for case 4.  By hypothesis, 
each of $T(M/e)$, $T(M\setminus e)$, $T(M/f)$, $T(M\setminus f)$,
$T(M/f/e)=T(M/e/f)$, $T(M/e\setminus f)$ and 
$T(M/f\setminus e)$ is well-defined.  Furthermore,
by Proposition \ref{SameMinorProp},
$M/e\setminus f$ $=$ 
$M/f\setminus e)$ as matroids or oriented matroids depending
on how $M$ was given.


Starting with $e$ and with $f$ give the two expressions:
\[
V=x_e x_f T(M/e/f) + x_e y_f T(M/e\setminus f) + y_e T(M\setminus e)
\]
\[
V\neq x_f x_e T(M/f/e) + x_f y_e T(M/f\setminus e) + y_f T(M\setminus f)
\]
Let $M'$ be the $P$-minor obtained by contracting each element
in $E(M)$ except for $e$ and $f$ ($M'=M$ if $n=2$.)
Since 
$E(M')=\{e,f\}$,
\eqref{TA} tells us that
\[
I(Q) (x_e y_f + y_e X_f) =
I(Q) (x_f y_e + y_f X_e),
\]
where $Q=M'/e \setminus f=M'/f \setminus e$.  The latter two
matroids or oriented matroids are equal because $e,f$ are in series
in $M'$ and so Proposition \ref{SameMinorProp} applies.
Since $A=E(M)\setminus\{e,f\}$ is a set of coloops ($\emptyset$ if $n=2$)
in
$M/e\setminus f$ $=$ $M/f\setminus e$, we 
write $X_A=\prod_{a\in A}X_a$ ($1$ if $A=\emptyset$)
by $X_A$ and use \eqref{TSSM} to write
\[
T(M/e\setminus f) = X_A I(Q ).
\]
and
\[
T(M/f\setminus e) = X_A I(Q ).
\]
\[
T(M\setminus e) = Y_f X_A I(Q ).
\]
\[
T(M\setminus f) = Y_e X_A I(Q).
\]
So
\[
x_e y_f T(M/e\setminus f) + y_e T(M\setminus e)
=
x_f y_e T(M/f\setminus e) + y_f T(M\setminus f)
\]
which contradicts 
$V\neq x_f x_e T(M/\{f,e\}) + x_f y_e T(M/f\setminus e) + y_f T(M\setminus f)$.

The remaining cases can be completed analogously.  It might be
noted that our proof differs slightly from \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}
in that the cases of $n=3$ and $n\ge 4$ are not distinguished.

\subsection{Universal Tutte Polynomial}
\label{UniversalSec}
It is easy to follow 
\cite{BollobasRiordanTuttePolyColored,Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi} to define
a universal, i.e., most general $P$-ported parametrized
Tutte function $T^{\mathcal{C}}$ for the $P$-minor closed class 
$\mathcal{C}$ given without parameters or initial values.  To do this,
we take indeterminates $x_e, y_e, X_e, Y_e$ for each $e\in E(\mathcal{C})$
and an indeterminate $[Q_i]$ for each $P$-quotient $Q_i\in\mathcal{C}$.
Let $\mathbb{Z}[x,y,X,Y]$ denote the integer polynomial ring generated by
the $x_e,y_e,X_e,Y_e$ indeterminates, define $\widetilde{\mathbb{Z}}$
to be the $\mathbb{Z}[x,y,X,Y]$-module generated by the $[Q_i]$.  
Let $I^{\mathcal{C}}$ denote the ideal of $\widetilde{\mathbb{Z}}$ 
generated by the identities of Theorem \ref{BigTheorem}, comprising 
for example $[Q_i](x_eY_f+y_eX_f-x_fY_e-y_fX_e)$ for each subcase of
case (a), etc.  The universal Tutte function has values in the
quotient module $\widetilde{\mathbb{Z}}/I^{\mathcal{C}}$.  Finally,
observe that the range of Tutte function $T$  can be considered to be
a module generated by the values $T(Q_i)$ over a ring $S$ containing the
$x,y,X,Y$ parameters; if the $T(Q_i)$ are in $S$, consider
$S$ to be the $S$-module. 
We follow \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi} to write
the corresponding consequence of Theorem \ref{BigTheorem}:


\begin{cor}
\label{UniversalCor}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a $P$-minor closed class of matroids or 
oriented matroids.  Then there is a 
$\widetilde{\mathbb{Z}}/I^{\mathcal{C}}$-valued function 
$T_P$ on $\mathcal{C}$ with $T_P(Q_i)=[Q_i]$ for each $P$-quotient
$Q_i\in\mathcal{C}$ that is a $P$-ported parametrized Tutte function
on $\mathcal{C}$ where the parameters are the 
$x, y, X, Y$ indeterminates.  Moreover, if $T$ is any $R$-parametrized
Tutte function with parameters $x'_e, y'_e, X'_e, Y'_e$, then $T$ is the
composition of $T_P$ with the homomorphism determined by
$[Q_i]\rightarrow T(Q_i)$ for $P$-quotient and 
$x_e\rightarrow x'_e$, etc., for each $e\in E(\mathcal{C})$.
\end{cor}

In the next section we define particular expressions for $T_P(M)$
which will be called Tutte polynomials.   Our purpose for
allowing Tutte function values and polynomials to be in
$R$-modules is that it facilitates giving formulas for 
Tutte functions of combinations such as direct sum in
terms of multiplication rules that make the module into algebra.


\section{Tutte Computation Trees and Activities}
\label{Activity}

Several authors \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Merino-1,Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}
surveyed the two ways that the 
two-variable Tutte polynomial can be defined:  It 
may be defined either as a universal solution to the
recursive strong Tutte equations, or as a generating function.
Further, two kinds of generating function definitions have been given.
The first is what Tutte originally used for graphs 
\cite{TutteDich,TutteGraphBook} and is
called the \emph{basis} or \emph{activities}
expansion. It enumerates each basis $B\subseteq E$ 
by a term $x^{i(B)}y^{e(B)}$, where the 
\emph{numbers of internally and externally active elements} 
$i(B)$ and $e(B)$ are determined from a given linear order
on the elements of $E$ (see Definition \ref{Activities-Ordered-Def}).
It was shown that even though $(i(B),e(B))$ for particular $B$
might vary with the order, the resulting polynomial is
independent of this order, and that it satisfies the Tutte equations.
The second, called the \emph{rank-nullity} generating function, 
is well-defined automatically
because it enumerates each subset $A\subseteq E$ with
the term $(x-1)^{(r(E)-r(A))}(y-1)^{(|A|-r(A))}$.  
This generating function is then shown to satisfy the Tutte equations.

A remarkable conclusion about adding parameters, 
given by Zaslavsky \cite{MR93a:05047},
is that the activities expansion generalizes to 
a universal form for Tutte functions whereas the 
rank-nullity function generalization can only
express the \emph{normal} Tutte functions.
The latter are characterized by \eqref{CNF}.  See sec. \ref{NormalSubSec}.

Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi} remarked that the Tutte equation
approach appears to give a shorter proof of the ZBR theorem
than the activities expansion approach. Diao and Hetyei \cite{RelTuttePoly} 
proved specializations
of Theorem \ref{BigTheorem} by means of the activities expansion approach.
The inductive proofs on $|E|$ that we and \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}
give demonstrate that every calculation of $T(M)$ from Tutte equations
produces the same result when the conditions on the parameters
and initial values are satisfied.  It it then almost a 
tautology that the polynomial expression
resulting from
a particular calculation will equal the Tutte function value in the
ring $R$.
We show that every recursive calculation (see below)
gives rise to an 
activities expansion, when the activities are defined in the
more general way given by McMahon and Gordon \cite{GordonMcMachonGreedoid}.
We suggest a heuristic reason why
the inductive Tutte equation approach is more succinct:
The induction assures that
\emph{every} computation for a matroid
with smaller $|E|$ gives the same result, not just those 
computations that are determined by linear orders on $E$.

We call any computation that uses Tutte equations
to find $T(M)$ in terms of the Tutte function of
indecomposibles and/or of $M'$ with $|E(M')|<|E(M)|$
\emph{recursive}.
All the recursive computations of $T(M)$ 
are expressible by ``computation trees,''
formally defined by McMahon and Gordon 
\cite{GordonMcMachonGreedoid}.
Their motivation was to generalize activities expansions and
the corresponding interval partitions of the subset lattice from
matroids to greedoids.  Unlike matroids, some greedoids
do not have an activities expansion for their Tutte polynomial
that derives from an element ordering.

Proofs of activities expansions for matroids, and their generalizations
for $P$-ported matroids, seem more informative and certainly
no harder when the expansions are derived from a general Tutte
computation tree, than when the expansions are only those
that result from an element order.   
From the retrospective that the Tutte equations
specify a non-deterministic recursive computation
\cite{Garey-Johnson}, it seems artificial to start with
element-ordered computations and then prove
first that all linear orders give the same result and 
second that it 
satisfies the Tutte equations, in order prove that 
all recursions give the same result.
We therefore
take advantage of the Tutte computation tree formalism
and the more general expansions it enables.


\subsection{Computation Tree Expansion}

We begin with the definition of what generalizes the matroid
bases in the activities expansion when $P\neq\emptyset$.  In the
following, $\mathcal{B}(M)$ denotes the set of bases in $M$.

\begin{definition}
Given $P$-ported matroid or oriented matroid $M$,
a \textbf{$P$-subbasis} $F\in \mathcal{B}_P(M)$
is an independent set  with $F\subseteq E(M)$
(so $F\cap P=\emptyset$) for which $F\dunion P$ is a spanning set
for $M$
(in other words, $F$ spans $M/P$).
\end{definition}

An equivalent definition was given in \cite{SetPointedLV}.
The following proposition shows our definition is equivalent to
that given in \cite{RelTuttePoly}.  $C$ and $D$ below are called 
``contracting and deleting sets'' in that paper.

\begin{prop}
$C$ is a $P$-subbasis if and only if
$C \subseteq E(\mathcal(M))$ has no circuits and 
$D=E(M)\setminus C$ has no cocircuits.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
$C$ has no circuits means $C$ is an independent set in 
$M$.
$D$ has no cocircuits means $D$ is independent in
the dual of $M$, i.e., $D$ is coindependent.  
$D$ is coindependent if and only if
$S(M)\setminus D=P\dunion C$ is spans
$M$.
\end{proof}


\begin{prop}
For every $P$-subbasis $F$ there exists an independent set $Q\subseteq P$
that extends $F$ to a basis $F\dunion Q\in \mathcal{B}(M)$.
Conversely, if $B\in\mathcal{B}(M)$ then $F=B\cap E=B\setminus P$
is a $P$-subbasis.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof} Immediate. \end{proof}


The next definition 
is also equivalent to one in \cite{RelTuttePoly}. It generalizes
Tutte's definitions based on element orderings \cite{TutteGraphBook,TutteDich} 
extended to
matroids \cite{CrapoAct}.  We will see that expansions based on 
computation trees generalize these further.

\begin{definition}[Activities with respect to a $P$-subbasis and an element
ordering $O$]
\label{Activities-Ordered-Def}
Let ordering $O$ have every $p\in P$ before every
$e\in E$.  Let $F$ be a $P$-subbasis.  Let $B$ be any basis for 
$M$ with $F\subseteq B$.
\begin{itemize}
\item Element $e\in F$
is internally active if $e$ is the least element
within its principal cocircuit with respect to $B$.  Thus, this principal
cocircuit contains no ports.  The reader can verify this definition is 
independent of the $B$ chosen to extend $F$.  Elements $e\in F$ that are
not internally active are called internally inactive.
\item Dually, element $e\in E$ with $e\not\in F$ is externally 
active if $e$ is the least element within its principal circuit with
respect to $B$.  Thus, each externally active element is spanned by 
$F$.  Elements $e\in E\setminus F$ that are not externally active
are called externally inactive.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Computation Tree, following \cite{GordonMcMachonGreedoid}]
\label{CompTreeDef}
A $P$-ported (Tutte) computation tree for $M$ is a
binary tree whose root is labeled by $M$ and which satisfies:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $M$ has non-separating elements not in $P$, then 
the root has two subtrees and there exists one such element $e$ for which 
one subtree is a computation tree
for $M/e$ and the other subtree is a computation tree for 
$M\setminus e$.

The branch to $M/e$ is labeled with ``$e$ contracted'' and 
the other branch is labeled ``$e$ deleted''.
\item Otherwise (i.e., every element in $E(M)$
is separating) the root is a leaf.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

An immediate consequence is
\begin{prop}
Each leaf of a $P$-ported Tutte computation tree for $M$
is labeled by the direct sum of some $P$-quotient
(oriented if $M$ is oriented) 
summed with loop and/or coloop matroids with 
ground sets $\{e\}$ for various distinct $e\in E$ (possibly none).
\end{prop}

\begin{definition}[Activities with respect to a leaf]
\label{ActivityTreeDef}
For a $P$-ported Tutte computation tree for $M$,
a given leaf, and the path from the root to this leaf:
\begin{itemize}
\item Each $e\in E(M)$ labeled ``contracted'' along this path
is called \textbf{internally passive}.
\item Each coloop $e\in E(M)$ in the leaf's matroid is
called \textbf{internally active}.
\item Each $e\in E(M)$ labeled ``deleted'' along this path
is called \textbf{externally passive}.
\item Each loop $e\in E(M)$ in the leaf's matroid is
called \textbf{externally active}.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{prop}
Given a leaf of a $P$-ported Tutte computation tree for $M$,
the set of internally active or internally passive elements 
constitutes a 
$P$-subbasis of $M$ which we say 
\textbf{belongs to the leaf}.  
Furthermore, every $P$-subbasis $F$ of $N$ belongs to a unique leaf.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
For the purpose of this proof, let us extend Definition \ref{ActivityTreeDef}
so that, given a computation tree with a given node $i$ 
labeled by matroid $M_i$,
$e\in E$ is called internally passive when $e$ is labeled 
``contracted'' along the path from root $M$ to
node $i$.  Let $IP_i$ denote the set of such internally passive 
elements.

It is easy to prove by induction on the length of the root to node $i$ path
that
(1) $IP_i\cup S(M_i)$ spans $M$ and 
(2) $IP_i$ is an independent set in $M$.  The proof
of (1) uses the fact that elements labeled deleted are non-separators.  The
proof of (2) uses the fact that for each non-separator 
$f\in M/IP_i$, $f\cup IP_i$ is independent in $M$.

These properties applied to a leaf demonstrate the first conclusion,
since each $e\in E$ in the leaf's matroid must be a separator by Definition 
\ref{CompTreeDef}.

Given a $P$-subbasis $F$, we can find the unique leaf with the
algorithm below.  Note that it also operates on arbitrary subsets of $E$.

\textbf{Tree Search Algorithm:} Beginning
at the root, descend the tree according to the rule: At each branch node,
descend along the edge labeled ``$e$-contracted'' if $e\in F$ and along
the edge labeled ``$e$-deleted'' otherwise (when $e\not\in F$).
\end{proof}

The above definitions and properties lead us to 
reproduce element order based activities:
\begin{prop}
Given element ordering $O$ in which every $p\in P$ is ordered
before each $e\not\in P$, suppose we construct the unique $P$-ported
computation tree $\mathcal{T}$ in which the greatest non-separator $e\in E$ is
deleted and contracted in the matroid at each tree node.

The activity of each $e\in E$ relative to ordering $O$ and
$P$-subbasis $F\subseteq E$ is the same as the activity
of $e$ defined with respect to the leaf 
belonging to $F$ in $\mathcal{T}$.
\end{prop}

\begin{definition}
\label{ActivitySymbolsDef}
Given a computation tree for 
$P$-ported (oriented) matroid $M$,
each $P$-subbasis $F\subseteq E$
is associated with the following subsets of non-port elements
defined according to Definition \ref{ActivityTreeDef}
from the unique leaf determined by the algorithm given above.
\begin{itemize}
\item $IA(F)\subseteq F$ denotes the set of internally active elements,
\item $IP(F)\subseteq F$ denotes the set of internally passive elements,
\item $EA(F)\subseteq E\setminus F$ 
denotes the set of externally active elements,
and 
\item $EP(F)\subseteq E\setminus F$ denotes the set of externally
passive elements.
\item $A(F)=IA(F)\cup EA(F)$ denotes the set of active elements.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{prop}
\label{PartitionProposition}
Given a $P$-ported Tutte computation tree for
$M$, 
the boolean lattice of subsets of $E=E(M)$
is partitioned by the collection of
intervals $[IP(F),F\cup EA(F)]$ (note $F\cup EA(F)=IP(F)\cup A(F)$)
determined from the collection
of $P$-subbases $F$, which correspond to the leaves.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Every subset $F'\subseteq E=E(M)\setminus P$ belongs to the
unique interval corresponding to the unique leaf found by the tree search 
algorithm given at the end of the previous proof.
\end{proof}

Dualizing, we obtain:

\begin{prop}
\label{DualPartitionProposition}
Given a $P$-ported Tutte computation tree for
$M$
the boolean lattice of subsets of $E=E(M)$
is also partitioned by the collection of
intervals $[EP(F),E\setminus F\cup IA(F)]$ 
(note $E\setminus F\cup IA(F)$ $=$ $EP(F)\cup A(F)$).
\end{prop}
\begin{proof} The dual of the tree search algorithm is to descend along
the edge labeled ``$e$-deleted'' if $e\in F$.
\end{proof}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The following generalizes the activities expansion expression given
in \cite{MR93a:05047} to ported (oriented) matroids, as well as 
Theorem 8.1 of \cite{SetPointedLV}.

\begin{definition}
\label{TuttePolyExpression}
Given parameters $x_e$, $y_e$, $X_e$, $Y_e$, and 
$P$-ported matroid or oriented matroid $M$
the Tutte polynomial expression
determined by the sets in Definition 
\ref{ActivitySymbolsDef} 
from a computation tree is 
given by
\begin{equation}
\tag{PAE}
\label{PAE}
\sum_{F\in \mathcal{B}_P}I(M/F|P)
\;X_{IA(F)}\;x_{IP(F)}\;Y_{EA(F)}\;y_{EP(F)}.
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

Each Tutte polynomial expression is constructed by applying some of the
Tutte equations. 
Each expression $M/F|P$ denotes a $P$-quotient of $M$, so the
expression is a polynomial in the parameters and in the initial values
$I(M/F|P)$.  We can consider each $P$-quotient to be 
a variable, which we denote $[M/F|P]$ as in \cite{sdcPorted}
(except we recognize now that $M$ and $M/F|P$ might
be oriented matroids).
Therefore, if $P$-ported Tutte function $F$ is in the domain $\mathcal{C}$
Tutte function $F$, then $F(M)$ is given by any Tutte polynomial
expression with $F(M/F|P)$ substituted for each oriented or 
unoriented matroid variable $[M/F|P]$.  
We have proven:

\begin{thm}
\label{ActivitiesTheorem}
For every $P$-ported parametrized Tutte function $T$ into $R$ 
on $\mathcal{C}$, 
for every computation tree for $M\in\mathcal{C}$
(and so for every ordering of $E(M)$), 
the polynomial expression \eqref{PAE} equals $T(M)$ in $R$ when
the initial values are assigned so $[Q_i]=T(Q_i)$ for every
$P$-quotient $Q_i$.
\end{thm}

\subsection{Expansions of Normal Tutte Functions}
\label{NormalSubSec}.

Zaslavsky \cite{MR93a:05047} defined \emph{normal} Tutte functions to be
those for which $T(\emptyset)=1$ \textbf{CHECK!!}, and for which there exist
$u$, $w\in R$ so that for each $e\in E(M)$,

\begin{equation}
\tag{CNF}
\label{CNF}
X_e = x_e + uy_e \text{ and } Y_e = y_e + wx_e.
\end{equation}

It is easy to generalize
the well-known rank-nullity expansion for the classical
Tutte polynomial to the following
expansion for a $P$-ported parametrized normal Tutte function.  A proof
that this is a universal solution for \eqref{TA} and \eqref{TSM} 
is easily obtained by including the $x_e,y_e$ parameters, and 
allowing $M$ and its minors to sometimes be oriented, into the proof
we detailed in \cite{sdcPorted}.

\begin{equation}
\tag{PGF}
\label{PGF}
T(M) = \sum_{A\subseteq E(M)}T(M/A \mid P)x_A y_{E\setminus A}
u^{r(M)-r(M/A\mid P)-r(A)}
w^{|A|-r(A)}.
\end{equation}

We can now also verify \eqref{PGF} expresses a normal Tutte function
by deriving it from the Boolean interval expansion obtained when 
\eqref{CNF} parameters are substituted into the activities expansion
of Theorem \ref{ActivitiesTheorem}.

\subsubsection{Boolean Interval Expansion}

The following proposition 
expresses the ported corank-nullity polynomial
in terms of a $P$-ported activities expansion.  
It is obtained by substituting
binomials $X_e=x_e+y_eu$, $Y_e=y_e+x_ev$ and leaving
the matroid or oriented matroid variables unchanged
in Definition
\ref{TuttePolyExpression}.  

\begin{prop}
The polynomial $R_P(M)$ is given
by the following activities and boolean interval expansion formula:
\begin{equation}
R_P(M)=
\sum_{F\in \mathcal{B}_P}[M/F|P]
%\left(
\Big(
\sum_{\substack{
       IP(F)\subseteq K \subseteq F\\
       EP(F)\subseteq L \subseteq E\setminus F
      }}
 x_{K\cup (E\setminus F\setminus L)}\;
 v^{\Card{E\setminus F\setminus L}}\;
 y_{L\cup (F\setminus K)}\;
 u^{\Card{F\setminus K}}\;\;
%\right)
\Big)
\end{equation}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Let $A=K\cup (E\setminus F\setminus L)$ within \eqref{PAE}.
We can verify $\scomp{A}=E\setminus A=L\cup (F\setminus K)$.
For each $A\subseteq E$ a unique $P$-subbasis $F$, and two tree leaves
are determined, one by the tree descending algorithm and the other leaf
by the dual algorithm.  Thus $A$ and $\scomp{A}$ respectively belong
to intervals within the boolean lattice partitions of Propositions
\ref{PartitionProposition} and \ref{DualPartitionProposition}.  In particular, 
$A\in[IP(F),F\cup EA(F)]$ and 
$\scomp{A}\in[EP(F),E\setminus F\cup IA(F)]$.
Therefore the terms in the above sum are equal one by one to the terms in
the corank-nullity polynomial's subset expansion
(Definition \ref{PGF})
because the terms are in correpondance with the subsets of $E(M)$.
\end{proof}


\subsubsection{Geometric Lattice Flat Expansion}


A formula for the unparametrized ported Tutte (or corank-nullity) 
polynomials
of non-oriented matroids in terms of the lattice of flats (closed sets)
and its Mobius function was given in \cite{sdcPorted}.  
We generalize: (1) The expansion's
monomials $[Q_i]$ can signify either oriented matroid minors,
when $M$ is oriented, or non-oriented minors
when $M$ is not oriented.  (2) The polynomial is parametrized
with $x_e$, $y_e$ for each $e\in E$.
The derivation relies on the
fact that the oriented or non-oriented matroid minor $[M/A|P]$
(according to whether $M$ is oriented or not) depends
only on the flat spanned by $A\subseteq E$.  

\begin{prop}
Let $N$ be an oriented or unoriented.
Let $R_P(M)$ be given by \eqref{PGF}.
In the formula below,
$F$ and $G$ range over the geometric lattice of flats contained
in $M$ restricted to $E$.
\begin{equation}
R_P(M)(u,v) = \sum_{Q_i} [Q_i]
      \sum_{\substack{F\leq E\\
                     [M/F|P]=[Q_i]
           }}
                   u^{r(M)-r(Q_i)-r(F)}
                   v^{-r(F)F}

                    (y_e+x_ev)

\section{Direct Sums and Objects with Matroids}
\label{DirectSec}

The introduction of ports $P$ into the
theory of separator-strong Tutte functions of direct
sums 
suffers from
two complications.  First, a $P$-family 
of matroids $\mathcal{C}$ can have more than the one indecomposible
$\emptyset$.
Second, $\mathcal{C}$ might be partitioned
into non-empty disjoint $P$-minor closed classes.
Each class has different indecomposibles.
The second situation also occurs when $P=\emptyset$ with 
minor closed subclasses
of graphs \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi} where deletion of isthmuses and isolated vertices is forbidden.
When $P\neq\emptyset$, each subclass can have multiple 
indecomposibles.  

We define an abstraction of graphs called 
\emph{$P$-families of objects with matroids or oriented matroids}.  
It facilitates a discussion of
how the known notions of separator-strong and strong Tutte functions
of graphs can be extended when deletion and contraction are
restricted to $e\not\in P$.
Proofs \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}
based on the one matroid of an indecomposible being
$\emptyset$ and on just one indecomposible graph (the edgeless
graph with $k$ vertices) in each subclass
also seem easier to generalize with Tutte computation trees.   
Our abstraction and proof
of Theorem \ref{ZBRmatroids} lead us to
formulate new ZBR-like conditions, see Theorem \ref{ZBRobjects} below.

It is useful to think that a $P$-ported Tutte computation tree may have
objects $N$ for its node labels, such as graphs,
that have matroids or oriented matroids $M(N)$ associated with them.
Each $N$ has elements $S(N)=S(M(N))$, 
each $p\in S(N)\cap P$ is called a port, and
$E(N)=S(N)\setminus P$.  Loops, coloops and non-separators of $N$
are characterized by their status in $M(N)$.  So we
say $N$ is an \emph{object with a matroid or an oriented matroid}.

Contraction $N/e$ and deletion $N\setminus e$ 
of object $N$ is defined when $e\in E(N)$; and
$e$ is not a coloop in $M(N)$ and 
$e$ is not a loop in $M(N)$, respectively.
Under those conditions, $M(N/e)=M(N)/e$ and 
$M(N\setminus e)=M(N)\setminus e$ (as matroids or
oriented matroids).
Thus $P$-minors are defined,
and an indecomposible or $P$-quotient
is a $P$-minor $Q$ for which $S(Q)=S(M(Q))\subseteq P$.

A $P$-family $\mathcal{N}$ is a $P$-minor closed class of 
objects with matroid or oriented matroids.
Tutte computation trees are then defined for such $N\in\mathcal{N}$.
The matroids of course
constrain the structure of these trees.  
It is possible
(as when edgeless graphs $G_k$ have different vertex sets but all
$M(G_k)=\emptyset$,
see sec. \ref{GraphSec}) for different objects, 
even different indecomposibles, to have the same 
matroid or oriented matroid.  It also natually occurs 
(see \ref{GraphSec}) that
$N/e\setminus f$ $\neq$ 
$N/f\setminus e$ (as objects) even though 
$M(N)/e\setminus f$ $=$ 
$M(N)/f\setminus e$.  The latter equation when 
$e,f$ are in parallel or in series (see Proposition
\ref{SameMinorProp}) is critical to the above ZBR theorems.
It is also conceivable that $N/e/f\neq N/f/e$ or
$N\setminus e\setminus f\neq N\setminus f\setminus e$.


We can say that $T$ on $\mathcal{N}$
is a $P$-ported separator-strong Tutte function
on $\mathcal{N}$ into 
the ring $R$ 
containing parameters $x_e, y_e, X_e, Y_e$
for each $e\in E(N)$ for some $N\in\mathcal{N}$, or
into an $R$-module containing the values on
the indecomposibles,
if $T(N)$ satisfies \eqref{TA} and \eqref{TSSM} for all $N\in\mathcal{N}$.
It follows:

\begin{prop}
$T$ is a $P$-ported separator-strong Tutte function
on $\mathcal{N}$ if and only if for each $N\in\mathcal{N}$,
all Tutte computation trees for $T(N)$ yield polynomial expressions
that are equal in the range ring or $R$-module.
\end{prop}

We can still talk about Tutte decompositions and a
Tutte computation tree for $N$ even  without 
a Tutte function.  If we are only given values $I(Q_i)$
for the indecomposibles, each Tutte computation tree 
for $N$ yields a value in the $R$-module generated by
the $I(Q_i)$.
The Tutte decompositions, and the universal
Tutte polynomial (if it exists!)
of each $N\in \mathcal{N}$
are determined by $M(N)$ and the indecomposibles, i.e., $P$-quotients
$Q_i$ in $N$, which of course satisfy $Q_i \in \mathcal{N}$.

See sec. \ref{GraphExamples} for graph examples.

The following easy observations
formalize how Tutte computation trees for $N$ and $N'$
have the same structure when $M(N)=M(N')$ and how 
the Tutte polynomials are related.

\begin{lem}
If $M(N)=M(N')$ and
$\sum_{i\in Z} I(N/B_i|P) r_i$ is the value from
Tutte computation tree $\mathcal{T}$
for $N$, then $\mathcal{T}$ can be relabelled
to construct a Tutte computation tree for $N'$
that yields the value
$\sum_{i\in Z} I(N'/B_i|P) r_i$
with the same index set $Z$ and $r_i\in R$ for $i\in Z$.
\end{lem}

\begin{prop}
If $T$ is a separator-strong Tutte function on $\mathcal{N}$
and 
$T(N)=\sum_{i\in Z} I(N/B_i|P) r_i$ 
is the Tutte polynomial expression from some computation tree,
then
$T(N')=\sum_{i\in Z} I(N'/B_i|P) r_i$
with the same index set $Z$ and $r_i\in R$ for $i\in Z$.
\end{prop}

It is a common situation that $\{N^1,N^2,N\}\subseteq\mathcal{N}$
and their matroids or oriented matroids $M(N^1)\oplus M(N^2)=M(N)$.
Tutte computation trees help.

\begin{definition}
If $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ are Tutte computation trees then
$\mathcal{T}_1\cdot \mathcal{T}_2$ is the tree obtained by appending
a separate copy of $\mathcal{T}_2$ at each leaf of $\mathcal{T}_1$.
The root is the root of the expanded $\mathcal{T}_1$.
\end{definition}

\begin{prop}
\label{SumProp2}

Suppose $N$, $N^1$ and $N^2$ are all in $\mathcal{N}$
and $M(N^1)\oplus M(N^2)=M(N)$.  Then if
$\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ are Tutte computation
trees for $N^1$ and $N^2$ respectively with values given
by \eqref{DS1} and \eqref{DS2}, then there is a Tutte
computation tree for $N$ that yields the value given
by \eqref{DS}.

\begin{equation}
\label{DS1}
\tag{DS1}
\sum_{Q^1_i}I(Q^1_{i})c_1(Q^1_{i})\text{ where }Q^1_i=N/B^1_i|P.
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{DS2}
\tag{DS2}
\sum_{Q^2_j}I(Q^2_{i})c_2(Q^2_{j})\text{ where }Q^2_i=N/B^2_i|P.
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\tag{DS}
\label{DS}
\sum_{Q^1_i,Q^2_j}I(Q_{i,j})c_1(Q^1_{i})c_2(Q^2_{j})
\text{ where }Q_{i,j}=N/B^1/B^2|P.
\end{equation}

Furthermore, if $T$ is a Tutte function on $\mathcal{N}$
and $T(N^1)$ and $T(N^2)$ equal the Tutte polynomials
given by \eqref{DS1} and \eqref{DS2} then 
$T(N)$ equals the polynomial given by \eqref{DS}.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}

We show how to relabel $\mathcal{T}_1\cdot\mathcal{T}_2$ to obtain 
a Tutte computation tree for $N$.  $M(N^1)\oplus M(N^2)=M(N)$ is defined
means $S(M(N^1))\cap S(M(N^2))=\emptyset$ and 
$S(M(N))=S(M(N^1))\cup S(M(N^2))$.   Each node of 
$\mathcal{T}_1\cdot\mathcal{T}_2$ is determined by 
by deleting and/or contracting some elements of
$E(M(N^1))\cup E(M(N^2))$.  Relabel that node with the 
$P$-minor of $N$ obtaining deleting and/or contracting the
same elements respectively.  The result is a computation tree for $N$
because $M(N^1)\oplus M(N^2)=M(N)$.  Assume $P\subseteq S(M(N))$
(otherwise, take a smaller $P$) and let $P^1=S(M(N^1))\cap P$
and $P^2=S(M(N^2))\cap P$.
At a leaf of the relabelled
tree, there will be the $P$-quotient $N/B_1/B_2)|P$ where
$B_1$ is a $P^1$-subbasis of $M(N^1)$ and $B_2$ is a $P^2$-subbasis
of $M(N^2)$.  

\end{proof}




\subsection{Strong Tutte Functions}

Zaslavsky defined a parametrized Tutte function $T$ on a minor-closed
family of matroids $\mathcal{C}$ to be strong if 
$T(M^1\oplus M^2)$ $=$ $T(M^1)T(M^2)$ whenever
$M^1$, $M^2$ and direct sum 
$M^1\oplus M^2\in \mathcal{C}$.  It follows from
the formula \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}
$T(M^1\oplus M^2)T(\emptyset)=T(M^1)T(M^2)$ for separator-strong
Tutte functions and $\emptyset=\emptyset\oplus\emptyset$ that a 
separator-strong Tutte function is strong if and only if
$T(\emptyset)$ is idempotent, i.e., $T(\emptyset)=T(\emptyset)^2$
(Corollary 2.3 of \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}).

Let us extend the definition of strong parametrized Tutte function
to $P$-families $\mathcal{N}$ of objects with matroids and oriented matroids,
in the way that abstracts the known notion of strong Tutte functions
on minor closed families of graphs\cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}.
Of course, taking $\mathcal{N}$ to be a $P$-family $\mathcal{C}$ of 
matroids or oriented matroids gives us the extension to such $\mathcal{C}$.
Then, there might still be indecomposibles besides or instead of $\emptyset$.

\begin{definition}
A $P$-ported separator-strong Tutte function $T$ on a $P$-family of 
objects $\mathcal{N}$
with matroids is called \emph{strong} if
whenever $\{N^1, N^2, N\}\subseteq\mathcal{N}$
and 
$M(N^1)\oplus M(N^2)=M(N)$, 
then $T(N^1)T(N^2)=T(N)$.
\end{definition}


We can use Proposition \ref{SumProp2}
to prove the generalization of
the $T(\emptyset)T(\emptyset)=T(\emptyset)$ 
characterization of strong Tutte
functions.

\begin{thm}
\label{StrongTheorem}
A $P$-ported separator-strong Tutte function $T$ on a $P$-family of 
objects 
with matroids or oriented matroids $\mathcal{N}$ 
is \emph{strong} if and only if
$T$ restricted to the indecomposibles of 
$\mathcal{N}$, is strong; i.e.,
whenever $Q^1$, $Q^2$ and 
$Q$ are indecomposibles and $M(Q^1)\oplus M(Q^2)=M(Q)$ then
$T(Q^1)T(Q^2)=T(Q)$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Every $P$-quotient is in $\mathcal{N}$, so clearly $T$ restricted
to the $P$-quotients is strong.

Conversely, suppose $N^1$, $N^2$ and $N$ are in $\mathcal{N}$ and
$M(N^1)\oplus M(N^2)=M(N)$, so Proposition \ref{SumProp2} applies.

Since $M(N^1)\oplus M(N^2)=M(N)$, 
$M(N/(B_1\cup B_2)|P)$ $=$ $(M(N^1)/B_1|P)\oplus (M(N^2)/B_2|P)$
$=$ $M(N^1/B_1|P)\oplus M(N^2/B_2|P)$.  
We now use the fact
that $Q_{ij}=N/B_1/B_2|P$, $Q^1_i=N^1/B_1|P$ and $Q^2_j=N^2/B_2|P$ are 
$P$-quotients and the hypothesis to
write $T(Q_{ij})=T(Q^1_i)T(Q^2_j)$.  


We therefore conclude $T(N)=T(N^1)T(N^2)$
from \eqref{DS1}, \eqref{DS2} and  \eqref{DS}.

\end{proof}

\subsection{Matroidal Direct Sums and Multiplicative Tutte Functions}

Often
$\mathcal{N}$ comes equipped with one 
operation ``$*$'', or more, that satisfy
the following definition.  
Examples for $P=\emptyset$ are disjoint union $\amalg$
and one-point unions of graphs \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi},
see sec. \ref{GraphSec}.


\begin{definition}
A partially defined binary operation ``$*$'' on
a $P$-family of objects with matroids or oriented matroids
$\mathcal{N}$ is \emph{a matroidal direct sum} if 
whenever $N^1*N^2\in\mathcal{N}$ is defined for
$\{N^1,N^2\}\subseteq\mathcal{N}$, the 
matroids or oriented matroids satisfy
$M(N^1)\oplus M(N^2) = M(N^1*N^2)$.
\end{definition}

Proposition \ref{SumProp2} applies
when $N^1*N^2=N$ is defined.
It gives a general recipe for $T(N^1*N^2)$ which generalizes
the identity \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}
$T(M^1\oplus M^2)T(\emptyset)=T(M^1)T(M^2)$ 
for separator-strong Tutte functions of
matroids.
The $P$-ported generalization is more complicated and generally cannot
be expressed by a product in the domain ring of $T$.  

\begin{prop}
\label{SumProp}
Suppose $*$ is a matroidal direct sum and
$N^1$, $N^2$ and $N^1*N^2$ are each members of a $P$-family
for which $T$ is a Tutte function.

If for $P$-quotients $Q^j_i$ and $R$-coefficients $c_j(Q^j_i)$, $j=1$ and $2$,
\begin{equation}
\label{MD1}
\tag{MD1}
T(N^1) = \sum_{Q^1_i}T(Q^1_{i})c_1(Q^1_{i})
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\label{MD2}
\tag{MD2}
T(N^2) = \sum_{Q^2_j}T(Q^2_{i})c_2(Q^2_{j})
\end{equation}
then
\begin{equation}
\label{MD}
\tag{MD}
T(N^1 * N^2) = \sum_{Q^1_i,Q^2_j}T(Q^1_{i}*Q^2_{j})c_1(Q^1_{i})c_2(Q^2_{j}).
\end{equation}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Substitute $Q_{i,j}=Q^1_i*Q^2_j$ in \eqref{DS} of Proposition \ref{SumProp2}.
\end{proof}


When $\mathcal{N}$ is a $P$-family of matroids or oriented matroids,
direct matroid or oriented matroid sum is obviously a matroidal direct
sum operation, and so Proposition \ref{SumProp} is applicable.

\begin{cor}\cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}
Let $P=\emptyset$.
$T(M^1\oplus M^2)T(\emptyset) = T(M^1)T(M^2)$ for Tutte
function $T$ of matroids.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
Our proof demonstrates how Proposition \ref{SumProp}
generalizes this formula to $P$-families.
The expansions \ref{DS1} and \ref{DS2} take the one-term form
$T(M^j) = T(\emptyset) c_j(\emptyset)$, $j$ $=$ $1,2$,
so $T(M^1)T(M^2)=T(\emptyset)^2 c_1(\emptyset) c_2(\emptyset)$
Expansion \ref{DS} is then
$T(M^1\oplus T^2)=T(\emptyset) c_1(\emptyset) c_2(\emptyset)$.
\end{proof}

Following the definitions for graphs in \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}, we write:

\begin{definition}
Given a matroidal direct sum $*$ on $\mathcal{N}$, 
a Tutte function $T$ on $\mathcal{N}$ is
\emph{multiplicative} (with respect to ``$*$'')
if whenever $N^1*N^2$ is defined
for $\{N^1,N^2\}\subseteq \mathcal{N}$, the Tutte
function values satisfy 
$T(N^1)T(N^2)=T(N^1*T^2)$.
\end{definition}

A strong Tutte function is certainly multiplicative
for any ``$*$'', but not conversely.  A consequence
of Proposition \ref{SumProp2} is that,
like strong Tutte functions, multiplicative
Tutte functions are characterized by being that way
on the indecomposibles.  

\begin{cor}
A $P$-ported Tutte function $T$ on $P$-family $\mathcal{N}$ 
is multiplicative with respect to matroidal direct product
``$*$'' if and only if 
for every pair of indecomposibles $\{Q_i, Q_j\}\in\mathcal{N}$ for which 
$Q_i*Q_j\in\mathcal{N}$ is defined, $T(Q_i)T(Q_j)=T(Q_i*Q_j)$.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof} 
When $N^1*N^2$ is defined, Proposition \ref{SumProp2}
applies because $M(N^1)\oplus  M(N^2)=M(N^1*N^2)$.
$T(N^1*N^2)=T(N^1)T(N^2)$ is then a consequence
of $T(Q_i*Q_j)=T(Q_i)T(Q_j)$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{ZBR-type Theorems}

Examples in sec. \ref{GraphSec} below force us to recognize that
for $N$ an object with a matroid or oriented matroid $M(N)$
with
${e,f}\in E(N)$ in series or in parallel,  it might
happen that $N/e\setminus f\neq N/f\setminus e$ even though,
by Proposition \ref{SameMinorProp}, 
$M(N)/e\setminus f\neq M(N)N/f\setminus e$.  Note that the
additional hypotheses 
in the theorem below do not pertain
to cases of Proposition \ref{SameMinorProp}.

\begin{thm}[ZBR Theorem for $P$-families of objects with matroids or
oriented matroids]
\label{ZBRobjects}

Let $\mathcal{N}$ be a $P$-family of objects with matoids or oriented
matroids.

Suppose, in addition, the $P$-minor operations
are commutative in the way they are for matroids.
Specifically, for all $N\in\mathcal{N}$ and $e,f\in E(N)$,
$N/e/f=N/f/e$, $N\setminus e\setminus f=N\setminus f\setminus e$,
$N/e\setminus f=N\setminus f/e$
whenever neither $e$ nor $f$ is a loop in any of these contractions
and neither is a coloop in any of these deletions.

The following two statements are equivalent.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $T$ from $\mathcal{N}$ to $R$ or an $R$-module is a $P$-ported 
separator-strong parametrized
$P$-ported Tutte function with $R$-parameters $(x, y, X, Y)$ whose values 
$T(Q_i)$ on $P$-quotients $Q_i\in\mathcal{N}$ are the initial
values $I(Q_i)$.
\item
For every $N\in\mathcal{N}$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
If $M(N)=U^{ef}_1\oplus M(Q_j)=U^{ef}_1\oplus M(Q_j')$ with 
$P$-quotients $Q_j=N/e\setminus f$ and $Q_j'=N/f\setminus e$,
\[
I(Q_j)(x_e Y_f - y_f X_e ) = 
I(Q_j')(x_f Y_e - y_e X_f).
\]
\item
If $M(N)=U^{efg}_2\oplus M(Q_j)=U^{efg}_2\oplus M(Q_j')$ with 
$P$-quotients $Q_j=N/e\setminus f/g$ 
and $Q_j'=N/f\setminus e/g$,
\[
I(Q_j)X_g(x_e y_f - y_f X_e ) = 
I(Q_j')X_g(x_f y_e - y_e X_f ).
\]
\item
If $M(N)=U^{efg}_1\oplus M(Q_j)=U^{efg}_1\oplus M(Q_j')$ with 
$P$-quotients $Q_j=N/e\setminus f\setminus g$  
and $Q_j'=N/f\setminus e\setminus g$,
\[
I(Q_j)Y_g(x_e Y_f - y_f x_e) = 
I(Q_j')Y_g(x_f Y_e - y_e x_f).
\]
\item
If $\{e,f\}=E(M(N))$ is a parallel pair connected to $P$, 
\[
I(Q_j)(x_e Y_f - y_f x_e) = 
I(Q_j')(x_f Y_e - y_e x_f)
\]
where $P$-quotients $Q_j=N/e\setminus f$
and $Q_j'=N/f\setminus e$.
\item
If $\{e,f\}=E(M(N))$ is a series pair connected to $P$, 
\[
I(Q_j)(x_e y_f - y_f X_e) = 
I(Q_j')(x_f y_e - y_e X_f)
\]
where $P$-quotients
$Q_j=N/e\setminus f$ 
and $Q_j'=N/f\setminus e$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Analogous to the proof we gave for Theorem \ref{BigTheorem}.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
A $P$-family of objects with matroids satisfies a ZBR-type theorem
with the identities given in Theorem \ref{BigTheorem} if, in 
addition to the $P$-minor operations being commutative as with
matroids, the object $P$-quotients 
$N/e\setminus f=N/f\setminus e$ when $\{e,f\}=E(N)$ is a series
or parallel pair,
$N/e\setminus f/g=N/f\setminus e/g$ when $\{e,f,g\}=E(N)$ is a 
triangle and 
$N/e\setminus f\setminus g=N/f\setminus e\setminus g$ when $\{e,f,g\}=E(N)$ 
is a triad.
\end{cor}

For convenience in subsequent discussion, we will
call a theorem with identities like those in 
Theorem \ref{BigTheorem}
or in the ZBR theorem for graphs given by Ellis-Monaghan and 
Traldi a ZBR-matroid type theorem, and one with identities
like those just above a ZBR-object type theorem.  The common
feature of these ZBR-type theorems is that the identities
are each associated with a minor having only two or three non-port
elements.

\section{Applications to Graphs}
\label{GraphSec}

The $P$-family of objects with matroids or oriented matroids abstraction
helps us explore multiple kinds of graphs and their $P$-ported
Tutte functions.  
We consider only separator-strong and strong Tutte functions.
We first  define graphs with labelled vertices and extend
Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi's ZBR theorem for graphs to them.

That is followed by an example whose Tutte functions do satisfy
ported ZBR-matroid type theorems, and one where only 
a ported ZBR-object type theorem is satisfied.

Indeed, the immediate generalization of that theorem
fails when $P\neq\emptyset$.  That is because, even when 
$P=\emptyset$ so the theorem holds, the Tutte function depends on the
indecomposible graphs, not just their matroids.  (????In the
$P=\emptyset$ case, the indecomposibles are $E_k$, the graphs
with no edges and $k$ vertices, so the matroids are all $\emptyset$.)
[[[SHOULD THIS BE IN SUM SECTION?? Next, 
we prove that a separator-strong Tutte function is strong if
and only if it is strong on the indecomposibles.  This is independent
of whether the graphs satisfy a ZBR-type theorem or not!]]]
The section concludes with a generalization of the ZBR theorem
for graphs with labelled vertices.  The Tutte function must
be equal on all indecomposibles $Q_i$ with the same partition $\pi$
of vertex labels, assignment of port edges in $Q_i$ to parts of
$\pi$, and matroid or oriented matroid on the port edges.
When $P=\emptyset$, all the matroids become $\emptyset$ as in
Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi's ZBR theorem for unlabelled graphs.


\begin{definition}
A $P$-minor closed class of graphs $\mathcal{G}$ is closed under deletion
of loops not in $P$, contraction of isthmuses (i.e, coloops in the graph's
matroid) not in $P$, and deletion and contraction of 
non-separating edges not in $P$.

A $P$-ported separator-strong Tutte function of graphs is defined
on $\mathcal{G}$ given with parameters in ring R 
and obeys the conditions \eqref{TA} and \eqref{TSSM} interpreted for
(directed) graphs with their graphic, i.e. circuit (oriented) matroids.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Labelled Vertices}

Since our attitude is to retain the labels of the entities not removed
by deletion or contraction,
we begin with a definition of data preserved in $P$-minors that is
more detailed than the number of graph components because
it includes vertex labels.  We remind the 
reader that our  definition \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi} 
of graph minor
excludes deletion of isthmuses or of isolated vertices, and 
considers the removal of a loop to be a deletion.

\begin{definition}[Graphs with set-labelled vertices]
\label{GSLVDefinition}
The elements of such a graph $S(G)=E(G)\dunion(P\cap S(G))$ are edges.
The vertices are labelled with non-empty
finite sets so the two sets labelling distinct vertices in one
graph are disjoint.  Only non-loop edges $e\not\in P$
can be contracted; when an edge is contracted, its two endpoints
are replaced by one vertex whose label is the union of the 
labels of the two endpoints.  Only non-isthmus edges $e\not\in P$
can be deleted; deletion doesn't change labels.  The graph
has its graphic matroid if it is undirected and its
oriented graphic matroid if it is directed.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Graphs with set-labelled components]
\label{GSLCDefinition}
The elements of such a graph $S(G)=E(G)\dunion(P\cap S(G))$ are edges.
The path-connected components are labelled by
non-empty finite sets so two components in the same
graph always have disjoint labels.  In other words,
the set labels of the components are a partition $\pi_V$
Only non-loop edges $e\not\in P$
can be contracted and only non-isthmus edges 
$e\not\in P$
can be deleted.
The component labels are unchanged by these minor operations.
Definition \ref{GSLVDefinition} specifies the
matroids or oriented matroids.

Two such graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ are \emph{equivalent}
means they have the same component label partition, the same
subset of port edges, and if $h\in S(G_1)\cap S(G_2)$
then the components of $G_1$ and $G_2$ that contain
$h$ have the same component labels.
\end{definition}

It is clear how to construct $P$-families of graphs with 
set-labelled vertices, or with set-labelled components,
result, from closing a collection of vertex labelled graphs
under $P$-minors.

\begin{lem}
Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a $P$-family of 
graphs with set-labelled components.  
Each part in the partition of $\mathcal{G}$ into
equivalent graphs is $P$-minor closed.
\end{lem}

It is clear that the
Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi's arguments can be extended to conclude:

\begin{prop}
A class of graphs with set-labelled components
$\mathcal{G}$ is $P$-minor closed
if and only if $\mathcal{G}_{\pi}$ is $P$-minor closed
for each non-empty equivalence class 
$\mathcal{G}_{\pi}\subseteq\mathcal{G}$.

A separator-strong $P$-ported Tutte function is well-defined on
a $P$-minor closed class of graphs with set-labelled
components if and only if it is 
well-defined on each non-empty equivalence
$\mathcal{G}_{\pi}\subseteq\mathcal{G}$.
\end{prop}


\subsection{Examples}
\label{GraphExamples}

The first example shows that graphs with vertices labelled by sets
satisfy a ZBR-type theorem only when $P=\emptyset$.

\input{c4p2Two.pdf_t}


The next example shows that additional conditions are required
for a ZBR-type theorem for $P$-ported graphs even when 
the vertices are unlabelled.

The major complication due to port edges is
illustrated with the graph $G$ composed of five edges in the circle
ordered $(e,p,f,q,r)$ where the ports $P=\{p,q,r\}$.  
$e$ and $f$ are a series pair connected to $P$, but
the $P$-quotient graphs $Q_1=G/e\setminus f$ and 
$Q_2=G/f\setminus e$ are different graphs, even though they have 
the same matroid.  $Q_1$ is the path $qrp$ and $Q_2$ is the path $pqr$.
So, if this $G\in\mathcal{G}$, a necessary condition would be
\begin{equation}
T(Q_1)(x_ey_f+y_eX_f) = T(Q_2)(x_fy_e + y_fX_e).
\end{equation}


\subsection{Strong Tutte Functions}

Strong parametrized Tutte functions for graphs are immediately
generalized to $P$-ported graphs, and Theorem \ref{StrongTheorem}
applies directly.  It generalizes part of the concluding
proposition about strong Tutte functions for graphs in 
\cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}.

In the case when $P=\emptyset$ and the vertices are unlabelled,
we can prove a strengthing of part of Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi's
Corollary 3.13.  It is stronger because it does not require 
any additional hypotheses on $\mathcal{G}$ to prove that all
initial values that occur are the same idempotent.

\begin{cor}
Suppose $T$ is parametrized Tutte function on a minor-closed class
of graphs $\mathcal{G}$ (note $P=\emptyset$.)  
$T$ is strong if and only if 
there is an idempotent $\alpha=\alpha^2\in R$ and $T(E_k)=\alpha$
whenever $\mathcal{G}_k\neq\emptyset$.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
$M(E_k)=\emptyset$ for all $k\geq 1$ and 
$\emptyset\oplus\emptyset=\emptyset$, so 
$T(E_i)T(E_j)=T(E_k)$ whenever $\mathcal{G}_i$,
$\mathcal{G}_j$ and 
$\mathcal{G}_k$ are all non-empty.  Hence, if
$\mathcal{G}_k\neq\emptyset$ then $T(E_k)T(E_k)=T(E_k)=\alpha$.
Further, if $\mathcal{G}_j\neq\emptyset$ with $j\neq k$,
$\alpha=T(E_k)=T(E_k)T(E_k)=T(E_j)$.
\end{proof}

The other case of Corollary 3.13 \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi} requires
additional conditions for a Tutte function that is multiplicative on
both disjoint union $\amalg$ and one-point union $\cdot$ to always
be strong.  Consider $\mathcal{N}=\{E_3, E_4, E_5, \ldots \}$,
$T(E_5)=0$ and $T(E_k)=1$ for $k\geq 3$, $k\neq 5$.  If $T$ were
strong then $1=T(E_3)T(E_4)=T(E_5)=0$, but this $T$ is multiplicative
on disjoint and one-point union because $E_5$ cannot be expressed
as either kind of union of graphs in $\mathcal{G}$.  The other conditions
are that $\mathcal{G}_k\neq\emptyset$ for all $k$ and that 
$\mathcal{G}$ is closed under one-point unions and removal of isolated
vertices.

\subsection{Matroidal Direct Sums in Graphs}

Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi derived relationships between the parametrized
Tutte functions of two graphs $G^1, G^2\mathcal{G}$ and their disjoint
union $G^1\amalg G^2$
and one-point union $G^1\cdot G^2$, where $\mathcal{G}$ was
a minor closed class.  Vertices were unlabelled and
$\mathcal{G}$ was partitioned into the minor-closed subclasses $\mathcal{G}_k$
of graphs with $k$ graph components.
In this situation, each non-empty $\mathcal{G}_k$ has exactly one
indecomposible $E_k$, the graph with no edges and $k$ vertices.  The
resulting ZBR theorem for graphs had $\alpha_k=T(E_k)$ in place of 
$\alpha=T(\emptyset)$ in the ZBR theorem for matroids, 
Theorem \ref{ZBRmatroids}.   Every Tutte function value had the
form $T(G)=\alpha_kr$, $r\in R$ where $G\in\mathcal{G}_k$.

\begin{prop}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $M(G)=M(G')$ then there exist $r_i\in R$ such that
$T(G)=\sum T(Q_i)r_i$ and $T(G')=\sum T(Q_i')r_i$, where
$Q_i'$ is the $P$-quotient of obtained by deleting and contracting
respectively the same set of edges from $G'$ as $Q_i$ was obtained
from $G$.

For $P=\emptyset$, this specializes to 
$T(G)=\alpha_{k}r$ and $T(G')=\alpha_{k'}r$ 
when $G\in\mathcal{G}_k$ and $G'\in\mathcal{G}_{k'}$ and 

\item
Given any $e\in E(G)$, one expression for $T(G)$ is
$\sum(r_iX_e + s_iY_e)T(Q_i)$.

For $P=\emptyset$, this specializes to 
$T(G) =(rX_e + sY_e)\alpha_k$, when $G\in\mathcal{G}_k$.

\item
If $G^1$, $G^2$ and $G^1\amalg G^2\in\mathcal{G}$ and
$T(G^j)=\sum T(Q^j_i)r^j_i$ for $i=1,2$, then
\begin{equation*}
T(G^1\amalg G^2)= \sum T(Q^1_i\amalg T(Q^2_j)r^1_ir^2_j
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
T(G^1)T(G^2)= \sum T(Q^1_i)T(Q^2_j)r^1_ir^2_j.
\end{equation*}

When $P=\emptyset$, this specializes to $T(G^1\amalg G^2)=\alpha_{k_1+k_2}r$
and $T(G^1)T(G^2)=\alpha_{k_1}\alpha_{k_2}r$.

\item $T$ is multiplicative with respect to $\amalg$, that is,
if $G^1$, $G^2$ and $G^1\amalg G^2$ are all in $\mathcal{G}$, then
$T(G^1\amalg G^2)=T(G^1)T(G^2)$, if and only if whenever
$Q_i$, $Q_j$ and $Q_i\amalg Q_j$ are all $P$-quotients in
$\mathcal{G}$, then $T(Q_i)T(Q_j)=T(Q_i\amalg Q_j)$.

When $P=\emptyset$, this specializes to $T$ is multiplicative
with respect to $\amalg$ if and only if
$\alpha_{k_1}\alpha_{k_2}$ $=$ $\alpha_{k_1+k_2}$
whenever $\mathcal{G}_{k_1}$, $\mathcal{G}_{k_2}$
and $\mathcal{G}_{k_1+k_2}$ are all non-empty.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
The first two can be proved as in \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}, or 
by analyzing Tutte computation trees

The last two follow from Proposition \ref{SumProp}.
\end{proof}

\cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi} also gave analogous results for
one-point union, which can be generalized in the same way.

\subsection{A Natural ZBR Theorem for Labelled Ported Graphs}


So, to generalize the ZBR theorem to graphs with port edges in 
a way that the edge deletion and contraction
operations remain compatible with both the
graphic matroid (or oriented matroid) structure and 
vertex structure, we have to add a hypothesis.  To do that
and get the exact generalization 
of Corollary 3.4, the generalized Zaslavsky–Bollob\'{a}s–Riordan theorem for 
graphs in \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}
we require that the function
values $T(G_1)=T(G_2)$ whenever graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ are 
are path-connected and have the same matroids (or oriented matroids).


The separator-strong reductions applied to a graph
clearly preserve the vertex set $V$ and the partition of $V$
induced by path-connectedness.  The graphic 2-edge-connectivity
structure is of course identical to the matroid connectivity structure.
It is therefore natural, and motivated by Diao and 
Hetyei's applications to virtual knots \cite{RelTuttePoly}, to define
a separator-strong Tutte function of graphs as follows:

\begin{definition}
Two graphs $G_1$, $G_2$ with the same vertex set $V$ and edge set $S$
have the same connectivity structure if and
only if they have the same graphic matroids (or oriented matroids) on
$S$ and the same partition of $V$ induced by path-connectedness.

A separator-strong Tutte function $T$ of graphs is a function from a $P$-family
of graphs to ring $R$ which satisfies \eqref{TA}, \eqref{TSSM} applied to
their graphic matroids and for which $T(G_1)=T(G_2)$ if $G_1$ and $G_2$ have
the same connectivity structure.
\end{definition}


Let us say two $P$-quotients $Q_i$ and $Q_j$ are equivalent if they
have the same matroid (or oriented matroid) and have the same connectivity
structure.

\begin{lem}
$F$ is a Tutte function on a $P$-family of graphs if and only if
$F$ satisfies 
\eqref{TA} and  \eqref{TSSM}, and $F(Q_i)=F(Q_j)$ for all pairs 
of equivalent 
$P$-quotients $Q_i$ and $Q_j$.
\end{lem}

\section{OLD GRAPH SECTION}

---------------$\downarrow$ Copied to new section ----------

Strong parametrized Tutte functions for graphs are immediately
generalized to $P$-ported graphs, and Theorem \ref{StrongTheorem}
applies directly.  It generalizes part of the concluding
proposition about strong Tutte functions for graphs in 
\cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}.

In the case when $P=\emptyset$ and the vertices are unlabelled,
we can prove a strengthing of part of Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi's
Corollary 3.13.  It is stronger because it does not require 
any additional hypotheses on $\mathcal{G}$ to prove that all
initial values that occur are the same idempotent.

\begin{cor}
Suppose $T$ is parametrized Tutte function on a minor-closed class
of graphs $\mathcal{G}$ (note $P=\emptyset$.)  
$T$ is strong if and only if 
there is an idempotent $\alpha=\alpha^2\in R$ and $T(E_k)=\alpha$
whenever $\mathcal{G}_k\neq\emptyset$.
\end{cor}


\begin{proof}
$M(E_k)=\emptyset$ for all $k\geq 1$ and 
$\emptyset\oplus\emptyset=\emptyset$, so 
$T(E_i)T(E_j)=T(E_k)$ whenever $\mathcal{G}_i$,
$\mathcal{G}_j$ and 
$\mathcal{G}_k$ are all non-empty.  Hence, if
$\mathcal{G}_k\neq\emptyset$ then $T(E_k)T(E_k)=T(E_k)=\alpha$.
Further, if $\mathcal{G}_j\neq\emptyset$ with $j\neq k$,
$\alpha=T(E_k)=T(E_k)T(E_k)=T(E_j)$.
\end{proof}

The other case of Corollary 3.13 \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi} requires
additional conditions for a Tutte function that is multiplicative on
both disjoint union $\amalg$ and one-point union $\cdot$ to always
be strong.  Consider $\mathcal{N}=\{E_3, E_4, E_5, \ldots \}$,
$T(E_5)=0$ and $T(E_k)=1$ for $k\geq 3$, $k\neq 5$.  If $T$ were
strong then $1=T(E_3)T(E_4)=T(E_5)=0$, but this $T$ is multiplicative
on disjoint and one-point union because $E_5$ cannot be expressed
as either kind of union of graphs in $\mathcal{G}$.  The other conditions
are that $\mathcal{G}_k\neq\emptyset$ for all $k$ and that 
$\mathcal{G}$ is closed under one-point unions and removal of isolated
vertices.

---------$\uparrow$ copied to new section-------------

It is natural to study separator-strong Tutte functions
on graphs.  See \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi} for details.
Our aim is to extend Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi's discussion
and results when a set of port edges $P$ is given so
deletion and contraction is done only of edges $e\not\in P$.
The extension of their definitions are

--------$\downarrow$ copied -----------

\begin{definition}
A $P$-minor closed class of graphs $\mathcal{G}$ is closed under deletion
of loops not in $P$, contraction of isthmuses (i.e, coloops in the graph's
matroid) not in $P$, and deletion and contraction of 
non-separating edges not in $P$.

A $P$-ported separator-strong Tutte function of graphs is defined
on $\mathcal{C}$ given with parameters in ring R 
and obeys the conditions \eqref{TA} and \eqref{TSSM} interpreted for
(directed) graphs with their graphic (oriented) matroids.
\end{definition}

---------$\uparrow$ copied -----------------------


Some useful features of graphs are preserved in minors 
restricted as above.
Any such feature partitions $\mathcal{G}$ into $P$-minor closed
classes, which of course have different indecomposibles.  Therefore,
a Tutte function on $\mathcal{G}$ is equivalent to Tutte functions
on separate subclasses, and these Tutte functions have no relations
between each other.  For example, when $P=\emptyset$ and vertices
are unlabelled, \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi} considered $\mathcal{G}$ 
partitioned into the subclasses $\mathcal{G}_k$ of graphs in
$\mathcal{G}$ with $k$ graph components.  The one indecomposible
in a non-empty $\mathcal{G}_k$ is $E_k$, the graph with
$k$ vertices and no edges.  Their ZBR theorem for graphs therefore
had $\alpha_k=T(E_k)$ in place of $\alpha=T(\emptyset)$ in the
matroid version.  Furthermore, one can express $T(G_i)=\alpha_{k_i}R_i$ with
some $R_i\in R$ when $G_i\in\mathcal{G}_{k_i}$.  The values on 
disjoint unions $G_1\amalg G_2$ and on one-point unions
$G_1\cdot G_2$ (the graphs share one vertex) can then be written
as $T(G_1\amalg G_2)=\alpha_{k_1+k_2}T(G_1)T(G_2)$ and
$T(G_1\cdot G_2)=\alpha_{k_1+k_2-1}T(G_1)T(G_2)$.  These product
formulas result from $E(G_1)\cap E(G_2)=\emptyset$ and that
the graphic matroid $M(G_1\amalg G_2)$ $=$ 
$M(G_1\cdot G_2)$ $=$ $M(G_1)\oplus M(G_2)$ is a direct sum.

Generalizing remarks from \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}, graphs
$G$ and $G'$ might belong to different $P$-minor closed classes
yet have the same matroid.  We can formalize how
the calculations of $T(G)$ and of $T(G')$ are identical by saying
that they have isomorphic collections of Tutte computation trees that
differ only at the leaves, and corresponding leaves have 
corresponding $P$-quotients.  Combined with Proposition \ref{SumProp}
this enables us to generalize the conclusions from 
\cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi} to graphs with port edges.  We will 
take one step further to consider the vertices to be labelled.
We end up with certain equivalence classes of graphs with among
other things, the same matroids or oriented matroids, as our
indecomposibles.





-------------------------------------------------------

The key fact about separator-strong Tutte decomposition of
graphs (with $P=\emptyset$) is that the indecomposibles
are the graphs $E_k$ consisting of $k$ isolated vertices.
In \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}, graph vertices are assumed to
be not labelled.
The identities and conditions in the ZBR theorem for graphs are identical 
to those in the theorem \ref{ZBRmatroids} for matroids except that the 
common factor in each identity is $\alpha_k=T(E_k)$ instead of
$\alpha=T(\emptyset)$, where $k$ is the number of (graph) components
in the graph to which the identity applies.

----------------$\downarrow$ Copied ---------------

The major complication due to port edges is
illustrated with the graph $G$ composed of five edges in the circle
ordered $(e,p,f,q,r)$ where the ports $P=\{p,q,r\}$.  
$e$ and $f$ are a series pair connected to $P$, but
the $P$-quotient graphs $Q_1=G/e\setminus f$ and 
$Q_2=G/f\setminus e$ are different graphs, even though they have 
the same matroid.  $Q_1$ is the path $qrp$ and $Q_2$ is the path $pqr$.
So, if this $G\in\mathcal{G}$, a necessary condition would be
\begin{equation}
T(Q_1)(x_ey_f+y_eX_f) = T(Q_2)(x_fy_e + y_fX_e).
\end{equation}

%%%%%\section{Ported Tutte Functions of Oriented Matroids}

... 
Application to express properties of negative correlation of
occurrances of graph edges in spanning trees and conjectures
for forests.



------------------------------------------------------------


Sagan and Gessel demonstrated \cite{GesselSaganDFS}
how various interesting identities involving interval partitions
can be proven by expanding the Tutte polynomial of a graph
by following various schemes for picking which edge to 
delete or contract at each stage.

--------------------------------------------------

NOTES: Matroid facts used: (1) A set in which each pair of elements is
either a series pair or a parallel pair has the property that the
whole set is either a series set or a parallel set.  (2) Commutation of
deletion and contraction on series pairs and on parallel pairs.
(I.E., if $e,f$ is series, then $M/e\setminus f$ $=$ $M/f/setminus e$, and 
dually).  Commutation of ordinary pairs. (I.E., $M\setminus e /f$
$=$ $M/f\setminus e$,  $M/e/f=M/f/e$, and 
$M\setminus e\setminus f$ $=$ $M\setminus f\setminus e$.)

The basis expansion originated by Tutte\cite{TutteDich}
for graphs and Crapo\cite{CrapoAct} for matroids depends on 
a particular but arbitrary ground set element order $O$.
Each basis determines a term from the internal
and external activities of elements with respect to that basis
according to the ordering $O$.
Our way to generalize is to 
restrict $O$ to orders in which
every port element is ordered before 
each $e\in E$.  (We use the convention that the deleted/contracted element
is the last, i.e., greatest element under order $O$ eligible for reduction.)

Gordan and McMahon define\cite{GordonMcMachonGreedoid} 
a ``computation tree''
to formalize the application of a subset of Tutte equations
to a matroid and some of its minors.
Each (Tutte) computation
tree determines
a polynomial in the parameters and point values.
Therefore, when
$\mathcal{N}$ is in the domain of a Tutte function, each
of these computation trees determine the same value.  
Computation
trees are a way to give
a basis expansion expression in terms of 
a more 
general definition 
of internal and external activities of elements
with respect to a basis.  The expansion is more general because it
is based on any Tutte equation computation rather than on an element order $O$.
We will extend to ported computation trees the
classification\cite{GordonMcMachonGreedoid} of elements as 
internally or externally, 
active or passive
with respect to each path down the tree.
In each case, the result is an interval
partition of the boolean subset lattice of $E$.  




the Tutte function is given by the following generalization of
what is often called the corank-nullity polynomial (see section \ref{Activity})

Tutte functions of this form are called
``normal'' in  their extension for $P\neq\emptyset$
is obvious.  Indeed, the ZBR theorem
is interesting because Tutte functions for some parameter
choices might fail to be normal.  Equation \ref{PGF} generalizes
to $P$-ported normal Tutte functions the corank-nullity
expansion given in Corollary 5.2 of \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}.

After verifying that the function given by this equation satisfies
the $P$-ported Tutte equations 
(following our calculations in \cite{sdcPorted}), 
we see that this $P$-ported
Tutte function of every matroid or oriented matroid exists for
arbitrary assignments of initial values $T(Q_i)$.  In \cite{TutteEx} we
utilized this fact to express an extensor-valued function $F$ of
$P$-ported graphic (and regular) oriented matroids by the assignments
$T(Q_i)=F(Q_i)$ and $u=w=0$ in \eqref{CNF}.  
It that paper, we
left open the question of whether for all parametrizations, not just
those for which \eqref{CNF} is satisfied, can the initial values
$T(Q_i)$ be assigned arbitrarilly.
Theorem \ref{BigTheorem} answers that question:
For the Tutte function to exist on $\mathcal{C}$, the $T(Q_i)$ can
be assigned arbitrarilly so long as the $(x,y,X,Y)$ parameters satisfy
identities each of the form $T(Q_i)p(x,y,X,Y)=0$ where $p$ is a 2nd or 
3rd degree polynomial in the $x,y,X$ and $Y$.  In particular, no
relation involves more than one $T(Q_i)$.


----------------------------------------


We can however
take advantage of the fact that every $P$-quotient $Q_i$ of 
$M=M^1\oplus M^2$ has a unique decomposition $Q_i=Q^1_{i_1}\oplus Q^2_{i_2}$
where $Q^1_{i_1}$ is a $P$-quotient of 
$M_1$ and $Q^2_{i_2}$ is a $P$-quotient of $M_2$.

The purpose of this paper is to extend, to matroids and graphs with
a set of distinguished elements $P$,  known results and methods pertaining
to solutions to \eqref{TA} together with the multiplicative
identities
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{M-P-T-identities}
T(M)=X_e T(M/e) \text{ if $e\in S(M)$ is a coloop}\\
T(M)=Y_e T(M\setminus e) \text{ if $e\in S(M)$ is a loop}\\
T(M_1\oplus M_2)=T(M_1)T(M_2)
\end{eqnarray}
when these identities are restricted to apply only when $e\not\in P$.
Solutions to \eqref{TA} and \ref{TSM} are
called \emph{Tutte functions}.  


Zaslavsky\cite{MR93a:05047}
defines the normal class of parametrized (but not ported) Tutte
functions as those Tutte functions for which there exist 
$u$ and $v$ for which, for all $e$,
the point value on coloop $e$ is $r_eu + g_e$ 
and the point value
on loop $e$ is $g_ev + r_e$.  The normal Tutte functions 
are exactly those obtained by substitutions into the parametrized corank-nullity
polynomial.  All Tutte invariants are normal Tutte functions
and non-normal Tutte functions do not express much of
the matroid structure---See 
\cite{MR93a:05047,BollobasRiordanTuttePolyColored,Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}
for details about how parametrization complicates Tutte invariant
theory.  

Our Theorem \ref{MEofUnimodularExt} expresses how
$\ext{M}_E(\mathcal{N})$ 
fits into the natural ported generalization of the
normal class.  Our extensor Tutte function of ported oriented 
unimodular matroids and its invariant specialization is expressed
by a substitution into the ported corank-nullity polynomial of
oriented matroids.

While only the normal Tutte functions have corank-nullity
polynomial expressions, they all have 
basis expansion expressions\cite{MR93a:05047}.
In the rest of this section, we discuss these and other
expansion expressions for ported unoriented and oriented matroids.

Unlike in the non-parametrized case, even without
distinguished elements, different formal polynomials result from
different calculations.  These formal polynomials are in the
parameters, values for $T$ of loops, coloops and the initial value
$T(\emptyset)$.  Additional polynomial identities in these values must
be satisfied in order for the values together with the to have a
solution.  A solution of course means that $T(M')$ for all the
(matroid) minors of $M$ satisfy all the Tutte identities;
equivalently, all calculation sequences give the same result.  When
the parameters are all $1$, the value for each loop is $t$, the value
for each coloop is $z$ and the initial value $T(\emptyset)=1$, it is
well-known that the identities have a unique solution which is a
polynomial in $z$ and $t$.  That is the famous Tutte polynomial.  It
is well-known as a universal Tutte invariant $U(M)(t,z)$--all Tutte
invariants $F(M)$ are obtained as $F(M)=U(M)(F(U_{0,1}),F(U_{1,1})$,
where $U_{0,1}$ is the loop matroid on any ground set $\{e\}$ and
$U_{1,1}$ is the coloop matroid.  Since additional conditions
involving parameters, loop/coloop, and empty matroid values are needed
for a solution, we will avoid the term ``Tutte polynomial'' for now
and use the term Tutte function to denote any solution to the
parametrized Tutte equations.

Several recent papers have demonstrated the essential equivalences
between most different, seemingly incompatible forms for solutions of
parametrized Tutte equations (which have been called ``Tutte
polynomials'').  Their conclusions are that, like for Tutte
invariants, universal solutions can be given.  Their conclusion is
that, like for Tutte invariants, universal solutions can be given so
that every Tutte function is obtained by a variable substitution into
the universal solution.

When $P=\emptyset$, the facts about separtor-strong Tutte functions
matroid direct sums easily follow from the formula
$T(M^1\oplus M^2)T(\emptyset)=T(M^1)T(M^2)$.  For example,
$T$ is strong if and only if $T(\emptyset)=T(\emptyset)^2$.
The theory of separator-strong Tutte functions of graphs covered
in \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}  follows from the fact that any
minor closed family of graphs (see below) $\mathcal{G}$ is partitioned into
subfamilies $\mathcal{G}_k$, each with just one indecomposible,
$E_k$, the edgeless graph with $k$ vertices, if $\mathcal{G}_k\neq\emptyset$.
Tutte function formulas for disjoint and one-point graph unions, 
and the conditions for strongness (defined $T(G^1)T(G^2)=T(G)$ if
matroids $M(G^1)\oplus M(G^2)=M(G)$) are then 
derived \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}
in terms of the values $\alpha_k=T(E_k)$.  Life is simple because
matroid $M(E_k)=\empty$ for all $k$.

The corresponding facts become more complex when the definitions
are naturally extended to $P$-ported matroids and graphs.  In a
$P$ ported graph $G$, some of the edges are in $P$ and the rest,
$E(G)$, satisfy $E(G)\cap P=\emptyset)$; and deletion, contraction,
$P$-minors, $P$-families and $P$-quotients (i.e., irreducibles)
are defined as they are for $P$-ported matroids or oriented matroids.
As in \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}
deletion of an isthmus (i.e., coloop in the matroid) and
contraction of a loop is forbidden.

The main difficulty is illustrated by the following example.
Take for 
$G$ a circle of the five edges
ordered $(e,p,f,q,r)$ where port set $P=\{p,q,r\}$.  
$e$ and $f$ are a series pair connected to $P$, but
the $P$-quotient graphs $Q_1=G/e\setminus f$ and 
$Q_2=G/f\setminus e$ are different graphs, even though they have 
the same matroid.  $Q_1$ is the path $qrp$ and $Q_2$ is the path $pqr$.
So, in analogy with $\alpha_{k_1}\neq\alpha_{k_2}$ for Tutte function
when $P=\emptyset$, function $T$ might satisfy \eqref{TA}
and \eqref{TSSM} even if $T(Q_1)=I(Q_1)\neq I(Q_2)=T(Q_2)$.
So, if this $G\in\mathcal{G}$, a necessary condition $\mathcal{G}$
for $T$ to be a (separator-strong, as always) Tutte function would be
\begin{equation}
I(Q_1)(x_ey_f+y_eX_f) = I(Q_2)(x_fy_e + y_fX_e).
\end{equation}
This equation does not have the form of 
those in the ZBR theorem for graphs \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}
because the latter's equations, like the equations in
Theorem \ref{BigTheorem}, each have a single factor $I(Q_i)$, 
$Q_i$ an indecomposible.

The example relies on the elements of $P$ being labelled.
This leads us to formulate a extension of Tutte function theory
for vertex labelled graphs.  The next example illustrates 
the same phenonemon as the first, in a smaller graph, when
the objects in $\mathcal{G}$ are graphs whose vertices are 
labelled by disjoint sets.  Again two different graphs have the
same oriented matroid.

\input{c4p2Two.pdf_t}

The expressions these two Tutte computation trees yield
are 
\[
I(Q_1)x_ex_f+I(Q_2)x_ey_f+I(Q_3)y_eX_f
\]
and
\[
I(Q_1)x_ex_f+I(Q_3)x_fY_e+I(Q_2)y_fX_e=
I(Q_1)x_ex_f+I(Q_2)y_fX_e+I(Q_3)x_fY_e,
\]
which are equal if and only if
\[
I(Q_2)(y_fX_e - x_ey_f)=
I(Q_3)(y_eX_f - x_fY_e).
\]
$Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are isomorphic as edge-labelled graphs
but are different when both the vertex and the edge
labels are present.

There are two other complications introduced
into $P$-families of matroids when $P\neq\emptyset$.
First, one matroid 
might have more than one $P$-quotient, i.e., indecomposible.
The most simple 
example is a digon matroid composed of one port and one
non-port element; and its $P$-minors.
Therefore, so minimal $P$-minor closed families might have 
more than one indecomposible.  
The second, which also occurs with the 
minor closed families of graphs \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}
in the original $P=\emptyset$ form, is that
the family is partitioned into disjoint $P$-minor closed
subfamilies.  Each subclass has its own indecomposibles,
$E_k$ in the case of graphs.
The ZBR theorem for graphs in \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}
has conditions analogous to those in Theorem \ref{ZBRmatroid},
except the factor $\alpha$ is replaced by $\alpha_k=I(E_k)$
depending on the subfamily.  

$P$-ported matroids or oriented matroids can be combined 
by matroid direct sum $\oplus$.  Graphs can be combined
by disjoint union $\amalg$ or by one-point union;
then each such combination $G$ of $G^1$ and $G^2$, if defined,
satisfies $M(G)=M(G^1)\oplus M(G^2)$.

\subsection{Graph Examples of Objects}

\begin{definition}[Graphs with set-labelled vertices]
\label{GSLVDefinition}
The elements of such a graph $S(G)=E(G)\dunion(P\cap S(G))$ are edges.
The vertices are labelled with non-empty
finite sets so the two sets labelling distinct vertices in one
graph are disjoint.  Only non-loop edges $e\not\in P$
can be contracted; when an edge is contracted, its two endpoints
are replaced by one vertex whose label is the union of the 
labels of the two endpoints.  Only non-isthmus edges $e\not\in P$
can be deleted; deletion doesn't change labels.  The graph
has its graphic matroid if it is undirected and its
oriented graphic matroid if it is directed.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Graphs with set-labelled components]
\label{GSLCDefinition}
The elements of such a graph $S(G)=E(G)\dunion(P\cap S(G))$ are edges.
The path-connected components are labelled by
non-empty finite sets so two components in the same
graph always have disjoint labels.  In other words,
the set labels of the components are a partition $\pi_V$
Only non-loop edges $e\not\in P$
can be contracted and only non-isthmus edges 
$e\not\in P$
can be deleted.
The component labels are unchanged by these minor operations.
Definition \ref{GSLVDefinition} specifies the
matroids or oriented matroids.
a1848 6
Two such graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ are \emph{equivalent}
means they have the same component label partition, the same
subset of port edges, and if $h\in S(G_1)\cap S(G_2)$
then the components of $G_1$ and $G_2$ that contain
$h$ have the same component labels.
\end{definition}
a1849 4
It is clear how to construct $P$-families of graphs with 
set-labelled vertices, or with set-labelled components,
result, from closing a collection of vertex labelled graphs
under $P$-minors.
d1851 1
a1851 6
\begin{lem}
Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a $P$-family of 
graphs with set-labelled components.  
Each part in the partition of $\mathcal{G}$ into
equivalent graphs is $P$-minor closed.
\end{lem}
d1853 11
a1863 18
It is clear that the
Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi's arguments can be extended to conclude:

\begin{prop}
A class of graphs with set-labelled components
$\mathcal{G}$ is $P$-minor closed
if and only if $\mathcal{G}_{\pi}$ is $P$-minor closed
for each non-empty equivalence class 
$\mathcal{G}_{\pi}\subseteq\mathcal{G}$.

A separator-strong $P$-ported Tutte function is well-defined on
a $P$-minor closed class of graphs with set-labelled
components if and only if it is 
well-defined on each non-empty equivalence
$\mathcal{G}_{\pi}\subseteq\mathcal{G}$.
\end{prop}

\subsection{Strong Tutte Functions}
a2039 37
In the case when $P=\emptyset$ and the vertices are unlabelled,
we can prove a strengthing of part of Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi's
Corollary 3.13.  It is stronger because it does not require 
any additional hypotheses on $\mathcal{G}$ to prove that all
initial values that occur are the same idempotent.

\begin{cor}
Suppose $T$ is parametrized Tutte function on a minor-closed class
of graphs $\mathcal{G}$ (note $P=\emptyset$.)  
$T$ is strong if and only if 
there is an idempotent $\alpha=\alpha^2\in R$ and $T(E_k)=\alpha$
whenever $\mathcal{G}_k\neq\emptyset$.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
$M(E_k)=\emptyset$ for all $k\geq 1$ and 
$\emptyset\oplus\emptyset=\emptyset$, so 
$T(E_i)T(E_j)=T(E_k)$ whenever $\mathcal{G}_i$,
$\mathcal{G}_j$ and 
$\mathcal{G}_k$ are all non-empty.  Hence, if
$\mathcal{G}_k\neq\emptyset$ then $T(E_k)T(E_k)=T(E_k)=\alpha$.
Further, if $\mathcal{G}_j\neq\emptyset$ with $j\neq k$,
$\alpha=T(E_k)=T(E_k)T(E_k)=T(E_j)$.
\end{proof}

The other case of Corollary 3.13 \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi} requires
additional conditions for a Tutte function that is multiplicative on
both disjoint union $\amalg$ and one-point union $\cdot$ to always
be strong.  Consider $\mathcal{N}=\{E_3, E_4, E_5, \ldots \}$,
$T(E_5)=0$ and $T(E_k)=1$ for $k\geq 3$, $k\neq 5$.  If $T$ were
strong then $1=T(E_3)T(E_4)=T(E_5)=0$, but this $T$ is multiplicative
on disjoint and one-point union because $E_5$ cannot be expressed
as either kind of union of graphs in $\mathcal{G}$.  The other conditions
are that $\mathcal{G}_k\neq\emptyset$ for all $k$ and that 
$\mathcal{G}$ is closed under one-point unions and removal of isolated
vertices.

each initial value $I(Q_i)$

$M(Q_i)$ and on the part $\pi$ for which $Q_i\in\mathcal{N}_{\pi}$.
\end{cor}
d2152 6
a2157 19
\begin{proof}
The 
value from each Tutte computation tree
for $N\in\mathcal{N}_{\pi}$ for fixed $\pi$ depends only on the
tree structure, which element is deleted and
contracted at each node plus the loop deletions and coloop
contractions, and the matroid or oriented matroid
$M(Q_i)$ of the indecomposible at each leaf.  This is
because of the hypothesis that $I(Q_i)$ depends only on $M(Q_i)$
and $\pi$.

The tree structure and elements depend only on the matroids $M(N')$
of objects $N'$ labelling the nodes.  The
value is independent of whether or not $N'/e/f=N'/f/e$, etc.,
because even if not,
\[
M(N'/e/f) = M(N'/e)/f = M(N')/e/f =
M(N')/f/e = M(N'/f)/e = M(N'/f/e).
\]
d2159 3
a2161 6
We have to prove that given $N_1$ and $N_2$ 
possibly different $P$-minors (as objects) of $N\in\mathcal{\pi}$
with $M=M(N_1)=M(N_2)$, if $\{e,f\} = E(N_1) = E(N_2)$
and $e,f$ are series or parallel in $M$, then
$M(N_1/e\setminus f) = M(N_2/f\setminus e)$.
That will establish that $I(N_1/e\setminus f) = I(N_2/f\setminus e)$.
d2163 17
a2180 11
To prove 
$M(N_1/e\setminus f) = M(N_2/f\setminus e)$ when $e,f$ 
are series or parallel, we write
\[
M(N_1/e\setminus f) =
M(N_1)/e\setminus f =
M(N_1)/f\setminus e =
M(N_2)/f\setminus e =
M(N_2/f\setminus e)
\]
by Proposition \ref{SameMinorProp}.

The purpose of this paper is to extend, to matroids and graphs with
a set of distinguished elements $P$,  known results and methods pertaining
to solutions to \eqref{TA} together with the multiplicative
identities
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{M-P-T-identities}
T(M)=X_e T(M/e) \text{ if $e\in S(M)$ is a coloop}\\
T(M)=Y_e T(M\setminus e) \text{ if $e\in S(M)$ is a loop}\\
T(M_1\oplus M_2)=T(M_1)T(M_2)
\end{eqnarray}
when these identities are restricted to apply only when $e\not\in P$.
Solutions to \eqref{TA} and \ref{TSM} are
called \emph{Tutte functions}.  


Zaslavsky\cite{MR93a:05047}
defines the normal class of parametrized (but not ported) Tutte
functions as those Tutte functions for which there exist 
$u$ and $v$ for which, for all $e$,
the point value on coloop $e$ is $r_eu + g_e$ 
and the point value
on loop $e$ is $g_ev + r_e$.  The normal Tutte functions 
are exactly those obtained by substitutions into the parametrized corank-nullity
polynomial.  All Tutte invariants are normal Tutte functions
and non-normal Tutte functions do not express much of
the matroid structure---See 
\cite{MR93a:05047,BollobasRiordanTuttePolyColored,Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}
for details about how parametrization complicates Tutte invariant
theory.  

Our Theorem \ref{MEofUnimodularExt} expresses how
$\ext{M}_E(\mathcal{N})$ 
fits into the natural ported generalization of the
normal class.  Our extensor Tutte function of ported oriented 
unimodular matroids and its invariant specialization is expressed
by a substitution into the ported corank-nullity polynomial of
oriented matroids.

While only the normal Tutte functions have corank-nullity
polynomial expressions, they all have 
basis expansion expressions\cite{MR93a:05047}.
In the rest of this section, we discuss these and other
expansion expressions for ported unoriented and oriented matroids.

Unlike in the non-parametrized case, even without
distinguished elements, different formal polynomials result from
different calculations.  These formal polynomials are in the
parameters, values for $T$ of loops, coloops and the initial value
$T(\emptyset)$.  Additional polynomial identities in these values must
be satisfied in order for the values together with the to have a
solution.  A solution of course means that $T(M')$ for all the
(matroid) minors of $M$ satisfy all the Tutte identities;
equivalently, all calculation sequences give the same result.  When
the parameters are all $1$, the value for each loop is $t$, the value
for each coloop is $z$ and the initial value $T(\emptyset)=1$, it is
well-known that the identities have a unique solution which is a
polynomial in $z$ and $t$.  That is the famous Tutte polynomial.  It
is well-known as a universal Tutte invariant $U(M)(t,z)$--all Tutte
invariants $F(M)$ are obtained as $F(M)=U(M)(F(U_{0,1}),F(U_{1,1})$,
where $U_{0,1}$ is the loop matroid on any ground set $\{e\}$ and
$U_{1,1}$ is the coloop matroid.  Since additional conditions
involving parameters, loop/coloop, and empty matroid values are needed
for a solution, we will avoid the term ``Tutte polynomial'' for now
and use the term Tutte function to denote any solution to the
parametrized Tutte equations.

Several recent papers have demonstrated the essential equivalences
between most different, seemingly incompatible forms for solutions of
parametrized Tutte equations (which have been called ``Tutte
polynomials'').  Their conclusions are that, like for Tutte
invariants, universal solutions can be given.  Their conclusion is
that, like for Tutte invariants, universal solutions can be given so
that every Tutte function is obtained by a variable substitution into
the universal solution.


For convenience in subsequent discussion, we will
call a theorem with identities like those in 
Theorem \ref{BigTheorem}
or in the ZBR theorem for graphs given by Ellis-Monaghan and 
Traldi a ZBR-matroid type theorem, and one with identities
like those just above a ZBR-object type theorem.  The common
feature of these ZBR-type theorems is that the identities
are each associated with a minor having only two or three non-port
elements.




\section{Applications to Graphs}
\label{GraphSec}

The $P$-family of objects with matroids or oriented matroids abstraction
helps us explore multiple kinds of graphs and their $P$-ported
Tutte functions.  
We consider only separator-strong and strong Tutte functions.
We first  define graphs with labelled vertices and extend
Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi's ZBR theorem for graphs to them.

That is followed by an example whose Tutte functions do satisfy
ported ZBR-matroid type theorems, and one where only 
a ported ZBR-object type theorem is satisfied.

Indeed, the immediate generalization of that theorem
fails when $P\neq\emptyset$.  That is because, even when 
$P=\emptyset$ so the theorem holds, the Tutte function depends on the
indecomposible graphs, not just their matroids.  
(????In the
$P=\emptyset$ case, the indecomposibles are $E_k$, the graphs
with no edges and $k$ vertices, so the matroids are all $\emptyset$.)
[[[SHOULD THIS BE IN SUM SECTION?? Next, 
we prove that a separator-strong Tutte function is strong if
and only if it is strong on the indecomposibles.  This is independent
of whether the graphs satisfy a ZBR-type theorem or not!]]]
The section concludes with a generalization of the ZBR theorem
for graphs with labelled vertices.  The Tutte function must
be equal on all indecomposibles $Q_i$ with the same partition $\pi$
of vertex labels, assignment of port edges in $Q_i$ to parts of
$\pi$, and matroid or oriented matroid on the port edges.
When $P=\emptyset$, all the matroids become $\emptyset$ as in
Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi's ZBR theorem for unlabelled graphs.


Since our attitude is to retain the labels of the entities not removed
by deletion or contraction,
we begin with a definition of data preserved in $P$-minors that is
more detailed than the number of graph components because
it includes vertex labels.  We remind the 
reader that our  definition \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi} 
of graph minor
excludes deletion of isthmuses or of isolated vertices, and 
considers the removal of a loop to be a deletion.

We following definitions are the immediate extensions
of the corrsponding known definitions.


\begin{definition}
A \emph{strong} $P$-ported Tutte function $T$ on a $P$-family 
$\mathcal{C}$ of matroids
or oriented matroids satisfies $T(M^1)T(M^2)=T(M^1\oplus M^2)$
when $M^1, M^2$ and $M^1\circ M^2$ are all in $\mathcal{C}$.
\end{definition}

Note that such a strong Tutte function is a separator-strong
Tutte function with $X_e=T(U^e_1)$ and
$Y_e=T(U^e_e)$ for all $e\in E(\mathcal{N})$.

We will give extensions of definitions of strong Tutte functions
and of multiplicative Tutte functions of graphs below when
we define $P$-families of objects with matroids or oriented 
matroids.

The remainder of the paper abstracts graphs to 
objects with matroids or oriented matroids to 
resolve the issues illustrated by the examples
when there are some port elements.  
Proofs as in 
\cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}
are based on the one indecomposible matroid 
being $\emptyset$, and on
there being just one indecomposible graph (the edgeless
graph $E_k$ with $k$ vertices) all with the
same matroid $\emptyset$ in each minor
closed subclass of graphs.
Our abstraction and Tutte computation
trees seem to make it easier to generalize
these results.  They also lead to
new type of ZBR-theorem that pertains the
situation illustrated by equation \ref{BadZBRExampleEq}.



\subsection{Objects with Matroids or Oriented Matroids}
a1842 315
The ZBR-type theorem that addresses the problem 
illustrated by \eqref{BadZBRExampleEq} require that
the $P$-family satisfy the following

\begin{definition}
Object $N\in\mathcal{N}$ is \emph{well-behaved} when
for every independent set $C\subseteq E(N)$ and
coindependent set $D\subseteq E(N)$ for which
$C\cap D=\emptyset$, each of the
$|C\dunion D|!$ orders 
of contracting $C$ and deleting $D$ produces the
same $P$-minor (which is an object) of $N$.

Specifically, let 
$C=\{c_1,\ldots,c_j\}$,
$D=\{d_{j+1},\ldots,d_k\}$
and $R_i(N')=N'/c_i$ if $1\le i \le j$
and $N'\setminus d_i$ if $j+1\le i \le k$.
The condition is 
$R_1\circ\cdots R_k(N) = R_{\sigma_1}\circ\cdots R_{\sigma_k}(N)$
for every permutation $\sigma$ of $\{1,\ldots,k\}$.

$\mathcal{N}$ is \emph{well-behaved} when 
each $N\in\mathcal{N}$ is well-behaved.

\end{definition}

By definition \ref{OMOMdef} 
all the minors are defined and
$M(R_1\circ\cdots R_k(N)) = M(R_{\sigma_1}\circ\cdots R_{\sigma_k}(N))$
independently of whether $N$ is well-behaved or not.
The point is that the objects themselves are the same.

We give two examples of well-behaved $P$-families.


\begin{definition}[Graphs with set-labelled vertices]
\label{GSLVDefinition}
The elements of such a graph $S(G)=E(G)\dunion(P\cap S(G))$ are edges.
The vertices are labelled with non-empty
finite sets so the two sets labelling distinct vertices in one
graph are disjoint.  Only non-loop edges $e\not\in P$
can be contracted; when an edge is contracted, its two endpoints
are replaced by one vertex whose label is the union of the 
labels of the two endpoints.  Only non-isthmus edges $e\not\in P$
can be deleted; deletion doesn't change labels.  The graph
has its graphic matroid if it is undirected and its
oriented graphic matroid if it is directed.
\end{definition}

A graph with set-labelled vertices is well-behaved because
the minor obtained  deleting contracting forest $C$
and deleting $D$ is determined by merging all the vertex labels
of each graph component of $C$ and deleting $D$.  Note
that the deletions do not affect the vertex labels.  Hence
it doesn't matter in which order the operations are done.


\begin{definition}[Graphs with set-labelled components]
\label{GSLCDefinition}
The elements of such a graph $S(G)=E(G)\dunion(P\cap S(G))$ are edges.
The path-connected components are labelled by
non-empty finite sets so two components in the same
graph always have disjoint labels.  In other words,
the set labels of the components are a partition $\pi_V$
Only non-loop edges $e\not\in P$
can be contracted and only non-isthmus edges 
$e\not\in P$
can be deleted.
The component labels are unchanged by these minor operations.
Definition \ref{GSLVDefinition} specifies the
matroids or oriented matroids.
\end{definition}


A non-well-behaved $P$-family $\mathcal{C}!$
can be constructed from
any $P$-family of matroids $\mathcal{C}$ with
some $M\in\mathcal{C}$ with $|E(M)|\geq 2$.  
Each member of $\mathcal{C}!$ is formed from
some $M\in\mathcal{C}$ together with some
history of deletions and contractions that
can be applied to $M$.  Let $c_e$ and $d_e$ be symbols
for contracting and deleting $e\in E(\mathcal{C})$
respectively; a history $h$ is a string of
such symbols.  
Let $M_i|h$ be the $P$-minor obtained by 
performing history $h$ on $M$, assuming it
is defined.  The objects of $\mathcal{C}!$
are all pairs $(M_i,h)$ for which 
$P$-minor $M_i|h\in\mathcal{C}$ is defined.
The matroid of $(M_i,h)$ is $M_i|h$, which
determines the element set, loops and coloops.
Deletion and contraction of $(M,h)$
is defined as follows:  If $e\in E(M|h)$ is not
a loop, then $(M,h)/e$ is defined by $(M,hc_e)$; 
define $(M,h)\setminus e$ analogously.


\subsection{ZBR-type Theorems}

Our first ZBR-type theorem generalizes
Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi's ZBR theorem for graphs.

\begin{lem}
Suppose $P$-family $\mathcal{N}$ is partitioned into
disjoint $P$-minor closed subfamilies $\{\mathcal{N}_{\pi}$.
Then $T$ is a Tutte function on $\mathcal{N}$ if and
only if $T$ restricted to $\mathcal{N}_{\pi}$ is
a Tutte function for each $\mathcal{N}_{\pi}$.
\end{lem}

\begin{thm}
Suppose $P$-family $\mathcal{N}$ is partitioned into
disjoint $P$-minor closed subfamilies $\{\mathcal{N}_{\pi}$,
and each initial value $I(Q_i)\in R$ depends only on
the matroid or oriented matroid $M(Q_i)$ and the
$\pi$ for which $Q_i\in\mathcal{N}_{\pi}$,

Then $T$ is a Tutte function with given parameters $(x,y,X,Y)$
and initial values $I(Q_i)$ if and only if it satisfies
the equations of Theorem \ref{BigTheorem}, interpreted
for families of objects with matroids or oriented matroids.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Idea:  The tree structure depends only on the matroids.  The initial
values, for trees of $N$ in the same subfamily, also depend only on the
matroid.  Therefore the ZBR-theorem for $P$-ported matroids or 
oriented matroids applies to each subfamily.  So it applies 
to all of $\mathcal{N}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
A Tutte function $T$ on $P$-family of objects with matroids $\mathcal{N}$
that is partitioned into disjoint $P$-minor closed subfamilies
$\{\mathcal{N}_{\pi}\}$
satisfies a ZBR-type theorem
with the identities given in Theorem \ref{BigTheorem} if
each initial value $I(Q_i)$ 
depends only on the matroid or oriented matroid
$M(Q_i)$ and on the part $\pi$ for which $Q_i\in\mathcal{N}_{\pi}$.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
The 
value from each Tutte computation tree
for $N\in\mathcal{N}_{\pi}$ for fixed $\pi$ depends only on the
tree structure, which element is deleted and
contracted at each node plus the loop deletions and coloop
contractions, and the matroid or oriented matroid
$M(Q_i)$ of the indecomposible at each leaf.  This is
because of the hypothesis that $I(Q_i)$ depends only on $M(Q_i)$
and $\pi$.

The tree structure and elements depend only on the matroids $M(N')$
of objects $N'$ labelling the nodes.  The
value is independent of whether or not $N'/e/f=N'/f/e$, etc.,
because even if not,
\[
M(N'/e/f) = M(N'/e)/f = M(N')/e/f =
M(N')/f/e = M(N'/f)/e = M(N'/f/e).
\]

We have to prove that given $N_1$ and $N_2$ 
possibly different $P$-minors (as objects) of $N\in\mathcal{\pi}$
with $M=M(N_1)=M(N_2)$, if $\{e,f\} = E(N_1) = E(N_2)$
and $e,f$ are series or parallel in $M$, then
$M(N_1/e\setminus f) = M(N_2/f\setminus e)$.
That will establish that $I(N_1/e\setminus f) = I(N_2/f\setminus e)$.


To prove 
$M(N_1/e\setminus f) = M(N_2/f\setminus e)$ when $e,f$ 
are series or parallel, we write
\[
M(N_1/e\setminus f) =
M(N_1)/e\setminus f =
M(N_1)/f\setminus e =
M(N_2)/f\setminus e =
M(N_2/f\setminus e)
\]
by Proposition \ref{SameMinorProp}.  

The two cases with $E(N)=\{e,f,g\}$ are proved similarly.

\end{proof}

---------------------------------------------------


The examples forced us to recognize that
for $N$ an object with a matroid or oriented matroid $M(N)$
with
${e,f}\in E(N)$ in series or in parallel,  it might
happen that $N/e\setminus f\neq N/f\setminus e$ even though,
by Proposition \ref{SameMinorProp}, 
$M(N)/e\setminus f= M(N)N/f\setminus e$.  Note that the
additional hypothesis that $\mathcal{N}$ is well-behaved
does not pertain
to cases of Proposition \ref{SameMinorProp}.

\begin{thm}[ZBR Theorem for $P$-families of objects with matroids or
oriented matroids]
\label{ZBRobjects}

Let $\mathcal{N}$ be a well-behaved 
$P$-family of objects with matroids or oriented
matroids.

The following two statements are equivalent.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $T$ from $\mathcal{N}$ to $R$ or an $R$-module is a $P$-ported 
separator-strong parametrized
$P$-ported Tutte function with $R$-parameters $(x, y, X, Y)$ whose values 
$T(Q_i)$ on $P$-quotients $Q_i\in\mathcal{N}$ are the initial
values $I(Q_i)$.
\item
For every $N\in\mathcal{N}$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
If $M(N)=U^{ef}_1\oplus M(Q_j)=U^{ef}_1\oplus M(Q_j')$ with 
$P$-quotients $Q_j=N/e\setminus f$ and $Q_j'=N/f\setminus e$,
\[
I(Q_j)(x_e Y_f - y_f X_e ) = 
I(Q_j')(x_f Y_e - y_e X_f).
\]
\item
If $M(N)=U^{efg}_2\oplus M(Q_j)=U^{efg}_2\oplus M(Q_j')$ with 
$P$-quotients $Q_j=N/e\setminus f/g$ 
and $Q_j'=N/f\setminus e/g$,
\[
I(Q_j)X_g(x_e y_f - y_f X_e ) = 
I(Q_j')X_g(x_f y_e - y_e X_f ).
\]
\item
If $M(N)=U^{efg}_1\oplus M(Q_j)=U^{efg}_1\oplus M(Q_j')$ with 
$P$-quotients $Q_j=N/e\setminus f\setminus g$  
and $Q_j'=N/f\setminus e\setminus g$,
\[
I(Q_j)Y_g(x_e Y_f - y_f x_e) = 
I(Q_j')Y_g(x_f Y_e - y_e x_f).
\]
\item
If $\{e,f\}=E(M(N))$ is a parallel pair connected to $P$, 
\[
I(Q_j)(x_e Y_f - y_f x_e) = 
I(Q_j')(x_f Y_e - y_e x_f)
\]
where $P$-quotients $Q_j=N/e\setminus f$
and $Q_j'=N/f\setminus e$.
\item
If $\{e,f\}=E(M(N))$ is a series pair connected to $P$, 
\[
I(Q_j)(x_e y_f - y_f X_e) = 
I(Q_j')(x_f y_e - y_e X_f)
\]
where $P$-quotients
$Q_j=N/e\setminus f$ 
and $Q_j'=N/f\setminus e$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
the Tutte function value 
for each tree depends only on the tree structure and the
initial values.
The fact the $\mathcal{N}$ is well-behaved
allows us to conclude that ...

The rest is analogous to the proof we gave for Theorem \ref{BigTheorem}.
\end{proof}



\begin{cor}
\label{IVEqualSerParCor}
A $P$-family of objects with matroids satisfies a ZBR-type theorem
with the identities given in Theorem \ref{BigTheorem} if, 
in 
addition $\mathcal{N}$ being well-behaved,
the initial values $I$ satisfy
$I(N/e\setminus f)=T(N/f\setminus e)$ when $\{e,f\}=E(N)$ is a series
or parallel pair,
$I(N/e\setminus f/g)=I(N/f\setminus e/g$ when $\{e,f,g\}=E(N)$ is a 
triangle and 
$I(N/e\setminus f\setminus g)=I(N/f\setminus e\setminus g)$ 
when $\{e,f,g\}=E(N)$ 
is a triad.
\end{cor}


\begin{cor}
A $P$-family of objects with matroids satisfies a ZBR-type theorem

addition to $\mathcal{N}$ being well-behaved,
the object $P$-quotients 
$N/e\setminus f=N/f\setminus e$ when $\{e,f\}=E(N)$ is a series

triangle and 
$N/e\setminus f\setminus g=N/f\setminus e\setminus g$ when $\{e,f,g\}=E(N)$ 
is a triad.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
Clearly, if $N/e\setminus f=N/f\setminus e$ then 
$T(N/e\setminus f)=T(N/f\setminus e)$, etc.

In his 1971 paper \cite{BrylawskiPointed}
``A Combinatorial Model for Series-Parallel Networks,''
Thomas H. Brylawski
addressed
series/parallel graphs, matroids,
series/parallel connections of matroids and 
relationships between these and Tutte polynomials.
The rules for 
combining graphs or matroids in series or parallel,
and thus for generating series/parallel graphs and matroids,
require
a basepoint edge or element.   To characterize
series/parallel matroids, and to study 
Tutte polynomials of series or parallel connections,
Brylawski defined 
a Tutte polynomial for ``pregeometries with basepoint $p_0$'' 
with the four variables $z$, $x$, $z'$ and $x'$.   His polynomial
is obtained from \eqref{PAE} in sec. \ref{Activity}
with the substitutions $P=\{p_0\}$,
$x_e=y_e=1$, $X_e = z$, $Y_e=x$ for all $e\neq p_0$, and
$[U^{p_0}_1]=z'$ and $[U^{p_0}_0]=x'$.  It satisfies
the well-known Tutte equations with deletion and contraction
allowed only for $e\neq p_0$.  
Additional references for this and the generalization
to specify more than one element to forbid from
being deleted or contracted
are given in 
sec. \ref{BackgroundSec}.

Very useful generalizations of Tutte polynomial
theory defined by attaching parameters to elements have 
been found.  This paper explores the combination
of parametrization with the restriction of deletion
and contraction in  Tutte equations
d194 1
d314 1
a314 21
of the kind we cover here.  

A different possibility might be found in section \ref{DirectSec} where
we consider ports with parametrized Tutte functions of graphs.
As in Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi's work, different indecomposible
graphs can have the same matroid.  To explore the issues more fully,
we define an abstraction 
called ``$P$-ported objects with matroids
or oriented matroids'' to which we can generalize the main results.
The abstraction and our theorems apply to situations where
an object represents an initial matroid, graph, etc. plus
a history of deletions and contractions.  The initial values
on indecomposibles, 
used for a Tutte decomposition to determine a Tutte function value
$T(N)$,
might then depend on the order of the deletion and contraction
reductions
to obtain each indecomposible from $N$.  This helps us understand the
theory, but whether objects with minors that depend on reduction 
order have useful applications remains to be seen.

are naturally extended to $P$-ported matroids and graphs.  As with
matroids, a $P$-ported graph $G$ has some of the edges in $P$ and the rest,
$E(G)$, satisfy $E(G)\cap P=\emptyset)$.  Deletion, contraction,

a1838 35
Since every $P$-minors $N'$ of $N$ has matroid
or oriented matroid $M(N')$ the same as the corresponding
minor of $M(N)$, we observe:

\begin{lem}
\label{ObjectTreeValueLemma}
The Tutte computation trees for $M(N)$ are in a one-to-one
correspondance with the 
Tutte computations tree for $N$ 
where corresponding trees are isomorphic.  In each
isomorphism,
corresponding
branches have the same labels ``$e$-contracted'' or
``$e$-deleted'' with $e\in E(N)=E(M(N))$, and a node
labelled $N_i$ in the tree for $N$ corresponds to 
a node labelled $M(N_i)$ in the tree for $M(N)$.

Each computation tree value is given by
the activities expansion \eqref{PAE} reinterpreted for
objects.
\end{lem}


We can still talk about Tutte decompositions and a
Tutte computation tree for $N$ even  without 
a Tutte function.  If we are given values $I(Q_i)$
for the indecomposibles, each Tutte computation tree 
for $N$ yields a value in the $R$-module generated by
the $I(Q_i)$ (which could be $R$).
The Tutte decompositions, and the universal
Tutte polynomial (if it exists!)
of each $N\in \mathcal{N}$
are determined by $M(N)$ and the indecomposibles, i.e., $P$-quotients
$Q_i$ in $N$, which of course satisfy $Q_i \in \mathcal{N}$.

Therefore:
d1858 11
a1868 51
We develop our first ZBR-type theorem for $P$-ported objects
with matroids or oriented matroids.  It is the
generalization of the ZBR theorem for graphs as given
by Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi\cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}.  
It depends on a lemma similar one of theirs.


\begin{lem}
\label{DisjSubclassLem}
Suppose $P$-family $\mathcal{N}$ is partitioned into
disjoint $P$-minor closed subfamilies $\{\mathcal{N}_{\pi}\}$.
Then $T$ is a Tutte function on $\mathcal{N}$ if and
only if $T$ restricted to $\mathcal{N}_{\pi}$ is
a Tutte function for each $\mathcal{N}_{\pi}$.
\end{lem}

\begin{thm}
Suppose $P$-family $\mathcal{N}$ is partitioned into
disjoint $P$-minor closed subfamilies $\{\mathcal{N}_{\pi}$,
and each initial value $I(Q_i)\in R$ depends only on
the matroid or oriented matroid $M(Q_i)$ and on the
$\pi$ for which $Q_i\in\mathcal{N}_{\pi}$,

Then $T$ is a Tutte function with given parameters $(x,y,X,Y)$
and initial values $I(Q_i)$ if and only if it satisfies
the equations of Theorem \ref{BigTheorem}, interpreted
for families of objects with matroids or oriented matroids.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
As in \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}, lemma
\ref{DisjSubclassLem} lets us prove the
theorem for each $\pi$ separately.


By Lemma \ref{ObjectTreeValueLemma}, $T$ is a 
$P$-ported Tutte function of family
of objects $\mathcal{N}_{\pi}$ if and only
if function $T'(M(N))=T(N)$ on the $P$-family of
the matroids or oriented matroids of
$N\in\mathcal{N}_{\pi}$ is a $P$-ported Tutte 
function, since by hypothesis 
$T'(M(Q_i))=I(Q_i)=I(M(Q_i))$ for corresponding
indecomposibles $Q_i\in\mathcal{N}_{\pi}$ and 
$M(Q_i)$ in the matroid or oriented matroid $P$-family.

We can therefore conclude the theorem
from Theorem \ref{BigTheorem} applied to
this matroid or oriented matroid $P$-family.

The following easy observations
formalize how Tutte computation trees for $N$ and $N'$
have the same structure when $M(N)=M(N')$ and how 
the Tutte polynomials are related.

If $M(N)=M(N')$ and
$\sum_{i\in Z} I(N/B_i|P) r_i$ is the value from
Tutte computation tree $\mathcal{T}$
for $N$, then $\mathcal{T}$ can be relabelled
to construct a Tutte computation tree for $N'$
that yields the value
$\sum_{i\in Z} I(N'/B_i|P) r_i$
with the same index set $Z$ and $r_i\in R$ for $i\in Z$.

If $T$ is a separator-strong Tutte function on $\mathcal{N}$
and 
$T(N)=\sum_{i\in Z} I(N/B_i|P) r_i$ 
is the Tutte polynomial expression from some computation tree,
then
$T(N')=\sum_{i\in Z} I(N'/B_i|P) r_i$
with the same index set $Z$ and $r_i\in R$ for $i\in Z$.

The distinction between weak Tutte functions (satisfying
an additive identity only)
and strong Tutte functions
(which satisfy \eqref{TSM} and \eqref{TA}) seems first to
have been made by Zaslavsky\cite{MR93a:05047}, for matroids.
That paper also defined weak and strong Tutte functions of
graphs.  However, we use using Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi's
definition of strong Tutte functions of 
graphs\cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}.
The latter restricts \eqref{TA} to non-separators (not just 
non-loops);  and it 
requires $T(G^1)T(G^2)=T(G)$ whenever 
matroids $M(G^1)\oplus M(G_2)=M(G)$ 
(which we sometimes interpret as oriented), not just when
$G$ is the disjoint union of $G^1$ and $G^2$.
We use the term separator-strong 
for the Tutte functions of matroids and graphs 
as defined in \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}; recall that
they satisfy \eqref{TA} and \eqref{TSSM}.
Normal is used in the same way as in\cite{MR93a:05047}.
We will repeat and extend these definitions with
little further attribution.

Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi's ZBR theorem for graphs 
refers to one initial value $\mathcal{\alpha}_k=I(E_k)$

is partition the $P$-ported graphs $G$ according to (1) how many
graph components $k$, (2) $P'=P\cap S(G)$ and (3)
$\nu:P'\rightarrow\{1,\ldots,k\}$.  Theorem

part and the matroid or oriented matroid of $G\in\mathcal{G}_{k,P',\nu}$.
Then there is $T$, $P$-ported separator-strong parametrized Tutte function
of graphs $\mathcal{G}$ satisfying $T(Q)=I(Q)=I_{k,P',\nu}(M(Q))$ whenever
$P$-quotient $Q\in\mathcal{G}_{k,P',\nu}$ if and only if the identities

We conclude with second ported generalization of 
Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi's ZBR theorem for graphs,
besides Corollary \ref{PZBRGraphCor1}.

\begin{cor}
\label{PZBRGraphCor2}
Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a ported $P$-family of graphs with
unlabelled vertices, as in Corollary \ref{PZBRGraphCor1}.
Then there is $T$, $P$-ported separator-strong parametrized Tutte function
of graphs $\mathcal{G}$ satisfying $T(Q)=I(Q)$ 
for all $P$-quotients $Q\in\mathcal{G}$ if and only if 
For every $G\in\mathcal{G}$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
If $E(G)$ is digon $\{e,f\}$ then
\[
I(Q)(x_e Y_f - y_f X_e ) = 
I(Q)(x_f Y_e - y_e X_f).
\]
where $Q=G/e\setminus f=G/f\setminus e$.
\item
If $E(G)$ is triangle $\{e,f,g\}$ then
\[
I(Q)X_g(x_e y_f - y_f X_e ) = 
I(Q)X_g(x_f y_e - y_e X_f ).
\]
where $Q=G/e\setminus f=G/f\setminus e$.
\item
If $E(G)$ is triad $\{e,f,g\}$ then
\[
I(Q)Y_g(x_e Y_f - y_f x_e) = 
I(Q)Y_g(x_f Y_e - y_e x_f).
\]
where $Q=G/e\setminus f=G/f\setminus e$.
\item
If $E(G)\{e,f\}$ is a parallel pair connected to $P$, 
\[
I(Q)(x_e Y_f - y_f x_e) = 
I(Q)(x_f Y_e - y_e x_f)
\]
where $Q=G/e\setminus f=G/f\setminus e$.
\item
If $E(G)=\{e,f\}$ is a series pair connected to $P$, 
\[
I(Q)(x_e y_f - y_f X_e) = 
I(Q')(x_f y_e - y_e X_f)
\]
where $P$-quotients
$Q=G/e\setminus f$ 
and $Q'=G/f\setminus e$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{cor}

Note: The last is the \emph{only} case where the equation is 
different from the one in the $P$-ported ZBR theorem for matroids
or oriented matroids.  

\begin{proof}
$\mathcal{G}$ is a well-behaved $P$-family of ported objects
with matroids or oriented matroids, so Theorem \ref{ZBRWellBehaved}
applies.

In all cases of Theorem \ref{ZBRWellBehaved} but the
last, the two object minors are the same graph 
because the contracted edges are path-connected,
so the equations of Theorem \ref{ZBRWellBehaved} are simplified.
\end{proof}

Both Corollaries \ref{PZBRGraphCor1} and \ref{PZBRGraphCor2} reduce
to the ZBR theorem for graphs when $P=\emptyset$.  The first
uses the property that $\mathcal{G}$ is partitioned into
minor-closed subclasses with indecomposibles $E_k$ 
for which the
initial values depend only on the matroid or oriented matroid to generalize
the original ZBR equations.  As with matroids, we find again that
the Tutte functions can distinguish different orientations of the 
the same undirected graphs.
The second relies on the 
commutivity of the graph minor operations and generalizes
the fact that different initial values may be assigned to
different indecomposibles, but then the 
conditions sufficient for the initial values to
extend to a Tutte function must be stronger.

$T(E_5)=0$.  $T(E_3)T(E_4)=1\neq T(E_5)$, so 
$T$ is not strong, but $T$ is multiplicative
on disjoint and one-point unions because $E_5$ cannot be expressed

Recent work on a different generalization, weak Tutte functions
(see sec. \ref{Complications}), has been done by 
Ellis-Monaghan and Zaslavsky \cite{ZaslavskyOct18}.
The distinction between weak Tutte functions (satisfying
an additive identity only)
and strong Tutte functions
(which satisfy \eqref{TSM} and \eqref{TA}) seems first to
have been made by Zaslavsky\cite{MR93a:05047}, for matroids.
That paper also defined weak and strong Tutte functions of
graphs.  However, we use using Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi's
definition of strong Tutte functions of 
graphs\cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}.
The latter restricts \eqref{TA} to non-separators (not just 
non-loops);  and it 
requires $T(G^1)T(G^2)=T(G)$ whenever 
matroids $M(G^1)\oplus M(G_2)=M(G)$ 
(which we sometimes interpret as oriented), not just when
$G$ is the disjoint union of $G^1$ and $G^2$.
The term separator-strong 
(I learned\cite{JoAndTom} 
after \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi} appeared.)
is used for Tutte functions of matroids and graphs 
as defined in \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}; recall that
they satisfy \eqref{TA} and \eqref{TSSM}.
Normal is used in the same way as in\cite{MR93a:05047}.
We will repeat and extend these definitions with
little further attribution.

a1885 1
To prove the generalization of

a1888 13
functions and investigate consequences of
$M(N^1)\oplus M(N^2)=M(N)$, 
we use the following definition:


\begin{definition}
If $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ are Tutte computation trees then
$\mathcal{T}_1\cdot \mathcal{T}_2$ is the tree obtained by appending
a separate copy of $\mathcal{T}_2$ at each leaf of $\mathcal{T}_1$.
The root is the root of the expanded $\mathcal{T}_1$.
\end{definition}

We now state and prove:

a1896 1
$T$ restricted to the indecomposibles, i.e., the $P$-quotients of 
a1902 1

d1908 3
a1910 18
$M(N^1)\oplus M(N^2)=M(N)$.  Let $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$
be Tutte computation trees for $N^1$ and $N^2$ respectively.  
We show how to relabel $\mathcal{T}_1\cdot\mathcal{T}_2$ to obtain 
a Tutte computation tree for $N$.  $M(N^1)\oplus M(N^2)=M(N)$ is defined
means $S(M(N^1))\cap S(M(N^2))=\emptyset$ and 
$S(M(N))=S(M(N^1))\cup S(M(N^2))$.   Each node of 
$\mathcal{T}_1\cdot\mathcal{T}_2$ is determined by 
by deleting and/or contracting some elements of
$E(M(N^1))\cup E(M(N^2))$.  Relabel that node with the 
$P$-minor of $N$ obtaining deleting and/or contracting the
same elements respectively.  The result is a computation tree for $N$
because $M(N^1)\oplus M(N^2)=M(N)$.  Assume $P\subseteq S(M(N))$
(otherwise, take a smaller $P$) and let $P^1=S(M(N^1))\cap P$
and $P^2=S(M(N^2))\cap P$.
At a leaf of the relabelled
tree, there will be the $P$-quotient $N/(B_1\cup B_2)|P$ where
$B_1$ is a $P^1$-subbasis of $M(N^1)$ and $B_2$ is a $P^2$-subbasis
of $M(N^2)$.  Since $M(N^1)\oplus M(N^2)=M(N)$, 
d1912 10
a1921 17
$=$ $M(N^1/B_1|P)\oplus M(N^2/B_2|P)$.  We now use the fact
that $Q_{ij}=N/(B_1\cup B_2)|P$, $Q^1_i=N^1/B_1|P$ and $Q^2_j=N^2/B_2|P$ are 
$P$-minors and the hypothesis to
write $T(Q_{ij})=T(Q^1_i)T(Q^2_j)$.  Meanwhile, the leaf corresponding
to $P_1$-subbasis $B_1$ in $\mathcal{T}_1$ is labelled $Q^1_i$ and the
leaf corresponding to $P_2$-subbasis $B_2$ in
$\mathcal{T}_2$ is labelled $Q^2_j$.   They contribute the 
factors $T(Q^1_i)$ and $T(Q^2_j)$ to the corresponding monomials
of the Tutte polynomials of $N^1$ and $N^2$ respectively.  

We therefore conclude that $T(N)=T(N^1)T(N^2)$.

Note that since both $N^1$ and $N\in\mathcal{N}$,
an identity from Theorem \ref{BigTheorem}, written  
$T(Q^1_i)(r)=0$ for some $r\in R$,
will occur if and only the identity $T(Q_{ij})(r)=0$ will occur when that
theorem is applied to $\mathcal{N}$.

\subsection{Matroid Direct Sums and Multiplicative Tutte Functions}
a1933 7
It is a common situation 
that $\mathcal{N}$ comes equiped with one 
combination operation ``$*$'', or more, 
each defined for some pairs $N^1,N^2\in\mathcal{N}$
for which $N^1*N^2\in\mathcal{N}$ and each 
is compatible with matroid or oriented matroid
direct sum.
d1936 1
a1936 1
A partially defined binary combination ``$*$'' on
d1945 6
a1950 30
Examples for $P=\emptyset$ are disjoint union $\amalg$
and one-point unions of graphs \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi},
see sec. \ref{GraphSec}.

Such operations are not necessarilly
defined on all pairs $N^1,N^2\in\mathcal{N}$.
We describe the common
structure for the Tutte computation trees 
where whenever the objects can be combined, their
the matroids are directly summed.  It is basically
the same structure we identified to prove
Theorem \ref{StrongTheorem}.


\begin{prop}
Suppose $N^1$ and $N^2$ are objects for which matroidal direct
sum $N^1*N^2$ is defined and they have Tutte computation trees
$\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ respectively.  Then
$\mathcal{T}_1\cdot\mathcal{T}_2$ and
$\mathcal{T}_2\cdot\mathcal{T}_1$ are each Tutte computation trees
for $N^1*N^2$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof} Immediate from the properties of matroid direct sum and
minors. \end{proof}


In this situation, we give a general recipe for $T(N^1*N^2)$ which generalizes
the identity $T(M^1\oplus M^2)T(\emptyset)=T(M^1)T(M^2)$ given 
by Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi for separator-strong Tutte functions of
d1953 1
a1953 5
be expressed by a product in the domain ring of $T$.  We can however
take advantage of the fact that every $P$-quotient $Q_i$ of 
$M=M^1\oplus M^2$ has a unique decomposition $Q_i=Q^1_{i_1}\oplus Q^2_{i_2}$
where $Q^1_{i_1}$ is a $P$-quotient of 
$M_1$ and $Q^2_{i_2}$ is a $P$-quotient of $M_2$.
d1959 1
a1959 3
so the Tutte function values $T(N^1)$, $T(N^2)$ and $T(N^1*T^2)$ 
are well-defined.

Given Tutte computation trees 
$\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ for $T(N^1)$ and $T(N^2)$, 
$T(N_1*N_2)$ has Tutte computation tree 
$\mathcal{T}=\mathcal{T}_1\cdot\mathcal{T}_2$.

We verify \eqref{DSUM-MATROID} term-by-term using the fact that each
leaf $L$ of $\mathcal{T}$ with $P$-quotient $Q_k$ corresponds 1-1 to a 
pair of one leaf in $\mathcal{T}_1$ with $P$-quotient $Q^1_i$ and 
one leaf in $\mathcal{T}_2$ with $P$-quotient $Q^2_j$, where
$Q_k=Q^1_i\oplus Q^2_j$.
a1984 3
Note that the statement requires that 
$T$ be a Tutte function whose domain $\mathcal{C}$ 
contains $N^1$ and $N^2$ together with $N^1*N^2$.

Following Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi's \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}

We will see that when $*$ is a matroidal direct sum,
some Tutte computation trees for $T(N^1)$, $T(N^2)$ and

d2206 47

The partition of a graph $G$ into its $k$ components induces a partition
of its vertex set into $k$ non-empty parts $\{V_1,\ldots,V_k\}$.  Let
$S_k$ be the set of edges in $G$ with endpoints in $V_k$.  Let us call
this vertex partition together with the edge set $S_i$ associated to
$V_i$ (but ignoring the vertex-edge incidences) the 
\emph{labelled vertex connectivity structure} $\pi_L (G)$.  
To accomodate minors, we consider each vertex to have multiple
labels and $V_i$ to contain all the labels of all the vertices in
the component.

A $P$-ported separator-strong Tutte function $T$ on a $P$-family
$\mathcal{N}$
of objects with matroids or oriented matroids is \emph{strong} if

\label{StrongThm}
A $P$-ported separator-strong Tutte function $T$ on $P$-family $\mathcal{N}$ 
of objects with matroids or oriented
matroids is strong if and only if whenever $Q^1$, $Q^2$ and 
$Q$ are indecomposibles and $M(Q^1)\oplus M(Q^2)=M(Q)$ then
$TQ^1)T(Q^2)=T(Q)$.
\end{thm}

----Reconcile the proofs--Try to use the above prop about $N^1, N^2, N$-------
d1787 6
a1794 23
\begin{proof}
If $T$ is strong, $T(Q)$
$=$ $T(Q^1)T(Q^2)$ must be satisfied for indecomposibles
because $Q^1$, $Q^2$ and $Q$ are all in $\mathcal{C}$.

Conversely, $T(M^1\oplus M^2)$ is expressed by 
\eqref{DSUM-MATROID} in Proposition \ref{SumProp}.  
$Q^1_{i}$, $Q^2_{j}$ and 
$Q^1_{i}\oplus Q^2_{j}$ are all $P$-quotients in 
$\mathcal{C}$ because the strong Tutte function definition
requires $M^1$, $M^2$ and $M^1\oplus M^2$ all be in 
$\mathcal{C}$.
By hypothesis,
$T(Q^1_{i}*Q^2_{j})$ $=$ $T(Q^1_{i}\oplus Q^2_{j})$ $=$
$T(Q^1_{i})T(Q^2_{j})$.  Therefore, 
we see $T(M^1\oplus M^2)=T(M^1)T(M^2)$ from the distributive law
applied to \eqref{D1} and \eqref{D2} of that Proposition \ref{SumProp}.

We can express

The universal Tutte polynomials of Corollary \ref{UniversalCor}
are in a module generated by the $P$-quotients, written as
symbols $[Q_i]$.  Let us 
extend this module to an algebra whose multiplication $\tilde{*}$
represents the matroidal direct sum $*$.

A $P$-family of objects $\mathcal{N}$ with matroids might have one or
more binary combination operations that are compatible
with matroid direct sum.  Such operations are not necessarilly
defined on all pairs $N^1,N^2\in\mathcal{N}$.
We describe the common
structure for the Tutte computation trees 
where whenever the objects can be combined, their
the matroids are directly summed.   We follow that with
a further abstraction that covers strong Tutte functions
of graphs and generalizes them non-empty port set $P$.

Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi derived relationships between the parametrized
Tutte functions of two graphs $G^1, G^2\mathcal{G}$ and their disjoint
union $G^1\amalg G^2$
and one-point union $G^1\cdot G^2$, where $\mathcal{G}$ was
a minor closed class.  Vertices were unlabelled and
$\mathcal{G}$ was partitioned into the minor-closed subclasses $\mathcal{G}_k$
of graphs with $k$ graph components.
In this situation, each non-empty $\mathcal{G}_k$ has exactly one
indecomposible $E_k$, the graph with no edges and $k$ vertices.  The
resulting ZBR theorem for graphs had $\alpha_k=T(E_k)$ in place of 
$\alpha=T(\emptyset)$ in the ZBR theorem for matroids, 
Theorem \ref{ZBRmatroids}.   Every Tutte function value had the
form $T(G)=\alpha_kr$, $r\in R$ where $G\in\mathcal{G}_k$.

\begin{prop}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $M(G)=M(G')$ then there exist $r_i\in R$ such that
$T(G)=\sum T(Q_i)r_i$ and $T(G')=\sum T(Q_i')r_i$, where
$Q_i'$ is the $P$-quotient of obtained by deleting and contracting
respectively the same set of edges from $G'$ as $Q_i$ was obtained
from $G$.

For $P=\emptyset$, this specializes to 
$T(G)=\alpha_{k}r$ and $T(G')=\alpha_{k'}r$ 
when $G\in\mathcal{G}_k$ and $G'\in\mathcal{G}_{k'}$ and 

\item
Given any $e\in E(G)$, one expression for $T(G)$ is
$\sum(r_iX_e + s_iY_e)T(Q_i)$.

For $P=\emptyset$, this specializes to 
$T(G) =(rX_e + sY_e)\alpha_k$, when $G\in\mathcal{G}_k$.

\item
If $G^1$, $G^2$ and $G^1\amalg G^2\in\mathcal{G}$ and
$T(G^j)=\sum T(Q^j_i)r^j_i$ for $i=1,2$, then
\begin{equation*}
T(G^1\amalg G^2)= \sum T(Q^1_i\amalg T(Q^2_j)r^1_ir^2_j
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
T(G^1)T(G^2)= \sum T(Q^1_i)T(Q^2_j)r^1_ir^2_j.
\end{equation*}

When $P=\emptyset$, this specializes to $T(G^1\amalg G^2)=\alpha_{k_1+k_2}r$
and $T(G^1)T(G^2)=\alpha_{k_1}\alpha_{k_2}r$.

\item $T$ is multiplicative with respect to $\amalg$, that is,
if $G^1$, $G^2$ and $G^1\amalg G^2$ are all in $\mathcal{G}$, then
$T(G^1\amalg G^2)=T(G^1)T(G^2)$, if and only if whenever
$Q_i$, $Q_j$ and $Q_i\amalg Q_j$ are all $P$-quotients in
$\mathcal{G}$, then $T(Q_i)T(Q_j)=T(Q_i\amalg Q_j)$.

When $P=\emptyset$, this specializes to $T$ is multiplicative
with respect to $\amalg$ if and only if
$\alpha_{k_1}\alpha_{k_2}$ $=$ $\alpha_{k_1+k_2}$
whenever $\mathcal{G}_{k_1}$, $\mathcal{G}_{k_2}$
and $\mathcal{G}_{k_1+k_2}$ are all non-empty.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
The first two can be proved as in \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}, or 
by analyzing Tutte computation trees

The last two follow from Proposition \ref{SumProp}.
\end{proof}

\cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi} also gave analogous results for
one-point union, which can be generalized in the same way.

It is useful to think that a $P$-ported Tutte computation tree may have
objects $N$ for its node labels, such as graphs or oriented matroids,
that have matroids $M(N)$ associated with them.  These matroids of course
constrain the structure of the tree.
Each $N$ has elements corresponding to $S(M(N))$.  Each $N$ has zero or

Two $P$-quotients $Q_i$, $Q_i'$ in a $P$-family of objects with
matroids $\mathcal{N}$ are equivalent if there exist $N\in\mathcal{N}$
and two subsets $B,B'\subseteq E(N)=E(M(N))$ that are both 
independent in $M(N)$, span the same flat (i.e., closed set)
$\overline{B}=\overline{B'}$ in $M(N)$, and for which
$Q_i=N/B|P$ and $Q_i'=N/B'|P$.

A $P$-ported parametrized separator-strong 
Tutte function $T:\mathcal{N}\rightarrow R$ 
on such an $\mathcal{N}$ satisfies $T(Q_i)=T(Q_i')$ for equivalent
$P$-quotients, in addition to conditions \eqref{TA} and \eqref{TSSM}.

If $M(N)=M(N')$ and
$T(N)=\sum T(Q_i) r_i$ is a Tutte polynomial expression for $T(N)$,
then
$T(N)=\sum T(Q_i') r_i$ is a Tutte polynomial expression for $T(N')$
with the same $r_i\in R$ and where $Q_i$ is equivalent to $Q_i'$ for each
term $i$.
\end{prop}
d1793 39
a1831 5
When the proof for Theorem \ref{BigTheorem} is revisited for
$P$-families of objects with matroids, each condition
has the form $I(Q_i)\cdot r$ $=$ $I(Q_i')\cdot r'$ with
equivalent $Q_i,Q_i'$.   In each case, independent sets
$B$ and $B'$ differ by the exchange of $e,f$.

Zaslavsky defined a parametrized Tutte function $T$ on a minor-closed
family of matroids $\mathcal{C}$ to be strong if 
$T(M^1\oplus M^2)$ $=$ $T(M^1)T(M^2)$ whenever
direct sum $M^1\oplus M_2\in \mathcal{C}$.  It follows from
the formula $T(M^1\oplus M^2)T(\emptyset)=T(M^1)T(M^2)$ for separator-strong
Tutte functions and $\emptyset=\emptyset\oplus\emptyset$ that a 
separator-strong Tutte function is strong if and only if
$T(\emptyset)$ is idempotent, i.e., $T(\emptyset)=T(\emptyset)^2$
(Corollary 2.3 of \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}).

Let us extend the definition of strong parametrized Tutte function
to $P$-families of matroids and oriented matroids.
(Note that a non-trivial direct sum would be indecomposible
if it had port elements only.)
There might be indecomposibles besides or instead of $\emptyset$.
The $T(\emptyset)T(\emptyset)=T(\emptyset)$ characterization generalizes
to:

d2107 5
a2111 6
\label{StrongCorr}
A $P$-ported Tutte function $T$ on $P$-family $\mathcal{C}$ 
of matroids or oriented
matroids is strong if and only if whenever $Q^1$, $Q^2$ and 
$Q^1\oplus Q^2$ are $P$-quotients in $\mathcal{C}$, $T(Q^1\oplus Q^2)$
$=$ $T(Q^1)T(Q^2)$.
a2113 1
----Reconcile the proofs--Try to use the above prop about $N^1, N^2, N$-------
d2115 28
d2145 9
a2153 4
\begin{proof}
If $T$ is strong, $T(Q^1\oplus Q^2)$
$=$ $T(Q^1)T(Q^2)$ must be satisfied for $P$-quotients because
$Q^1$, $Q^2$ and $Q^1\oplus Q^2$ are all in $\mathcal{C}$.
a2154 13
Conversely, $T(M^1\oplus M^2)$ is expressed by 
\eqref{DSUM-MATROID} in Proposition \ref{SumProp}.  
$Q^1_{i}$, $Q^2_{j}$ and 
$Q^1_{i}\oplus Q^2_{j}$ are all $P$-quotients in 
$\mathcal{C}$ because the strong Tutte function definition
requires $M^1$, $M^2$ and $M^1\oplus M^2$ all be in 
$\mathcal{C}$.
By hypothesis,
$T(Q^1_{i}*Q^2_{j})$ $=$ $T(Q^1_{i}\oplus Q^2_{j})$ $=$
$T(Q^1_{i})T(Q^2_{j})$.  Therefore, 
we see $T(M^1\oplus M^2)=T(M^1)T(M^2)$ from the distributive law
applied to \eqref{D1} and \eqref{D2} of that Proposition \ref{SumProp}.

$\mathcal{N}$, is strong.
\end{thm}
d2177 22

\begin{proof}
Every $P$-quotient is in $\mathcal{N}$, so clearly $T$ restricted

Conversely, suppose $N^1$, $N^2$ and $N$ are in $\mathcal{N}$ and
$M(N^1)\oplus M(N^2)=M(N)$.  Let $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$
be Tutte computation trees for $N^1$ and $N^2$ respectively.  
We show how to relabel $\mathcal{T}_1\cdot\mathcal{T}_2$ to obtain 
a Tutte computation tree for $N$.  $M(N^1)\oplus M(N^2)=M(N)$ is defined
means $S(M(N^1))\cap S(M(N^2))=\emptyset$ and 
$S(M(N))=S(M(N^1))\cup S(M(N^2))$.   Each node of 
$\mathcal{T}_1\cdot\mathcal{T}_2$ is labelled by a $P$-minor of
$N$ determined by deleting and/or contracting the elements of
$E(M(N^1))$ and $E(M(N^2))$.  Relabel that node with the 
$P$-minor of $N$ obtaining deleting and/or contracting the
same elements.  The result is a computation tree for $N$
because $M(N^1)\oplus M(N^2)=M(N)$.  Assume $P\subseteq S(M(N))$
(otherwise, take a smaller $P$) and let $P^1=S(M(N^1))\cap P$
and $P^2=S(M(N^2))\cap P$.
At a leaf of the relabelled
tree, there will be the $P$-quotient $N/(B_1\cup B_2)|P$ where
$B_1$ is a $P^1$-subbasis of $M(N^1)$ and $B_2$ is a $P^2$-subbasis
of $M(N^2)$.  Since $M(N^1)\oplus M(N^2)=M(N)$, 
$M(N/(B_1\cup B_2)|P)$ $=$ $(M(N^1)/B_1|P)\oplus (M(N^2)/B_2|P)$
$=$ $M(N^1/B_1|P)\oplus M(N^2/B_2|P)$.  We now use the fact
that $Q_{ij}=N/(B_1\cup B_2)|P$, $Q^1_i=N^1/B_1|P$ and $Q^2_j=N^2/B_2|P$ are 
$P$-minors and the hypothesis to
write $T(Q_{ij})=T(Q^1_i)T(Q^2_j)$.  Meanwhile, the leaf corresponding
to $P_1$-subbasis $B_1$ in $\mathcal{T}_1$ is labelled $Q^1_i$ and the
leaf corresponding to $P_2$-subbasis $B_2$ in
$\mathcal{T}_2$ is labelled $Q^2_j$.   They contribute the 
factors $T(Q^1_i)$ and $T(Q^2_j)$ to the corresponding monomials
of the Tutte polynomials of $N^1$ and $N^2$ respectively.  
d2207 7
a2213 1
We therefore conclude that $T(N)=T(N^1)T(N^2)$.
d2215 2
a2216 5
It might interest some to note that since both $N^1$ and $N\in\mathcal{N}$,
an identity from Theorem \ref{BigTheorem}  $T(Q^1_i)(r)=0$ for some $r\in R$
will occur if and only the identity $T(Q_{ij})(r)=0$ will occur when that
theorem is applied to $\mathcal{N}$.

Since our attitude is to retain the labels of the entities not removed
by deletion or contraction,
we begin with a definition of data preserved in $P$-minors that is
more detailed than the number of graph components.  We remind the 
reader that Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi's definition of graph minor
excludes deletion of isthmuses or of isolated vertices, and 
considers the removal of a loop to be a deletion.
We begin by including the vertices too.

The partition of a graph $G$ into its $k$ components induces a partition
of its vertex set into $k$ non-empty parts $\{V_1,\ldots,V_k\}$.  Let
$S_k$ be the set of edges in $G$ with endpoints in $V_k$.  Let us call
this vertex partition together with the edge set $S_i$ associated to
$V_i$ (but ignoring the vertex-edge incidences) the 
\emph{labelled vertex connectivity structure} $\pi_L (G)$.  
To accomodate minors, we consider each vertex to have multiple
labels and $V_i$ to contain all the labels of all the vertices in
the component.

It is clear that the
Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi's arguments can be extended to conclude:

\begin{prop}
A class of graphs $\mathcal{G}$ is $P$-minor closed
if and only if $\mathcal{G}_{\pi}$ is $P$-minor closed
for each non-empty subclass of $\mathcal{G}_{\pi}$
of graphs in $\mathcal{G}$ with the same labelled vertex connectivity 
structure $\pi$.

A separator-strong $P$-ported Tutte function is well-defined on
a $P$-minor closed class of graphs if and only if it is 
well-defined on every non-empty subclass $\mathcal{G}_{\pi}$
with the same labelled vertex connectivity structure $\pi$.
\end{prop}
d2439 1
a2439 10
So, to generalize the ZBR theorem to graphs with port edges in 
a way that the edge deletion and contraction
operations remain compatible with both the
graphic matroid (or oriented matroid) structure and 
vertex structure, we have to add a hypothesis.  To do that
and get the exact generalization Theorem .. of 
\cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}, we require that the function
values $T(G_1)=T(G_2)$ whenever graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ are 
are path-connected and have the same matroids (or oriented matroids).

a2440 39
The separator-strong reductions applied to a graph
clearly preserve the vertex set $V$ and the partition of $V$
induced by path-connectedness.  The graphic 2-edge-connectivity
structure is of course identical to the matroid connectivity structure.
It is therefore natural, and motivated by DH's applications, to define
a separator-strong Tutte function of graphs as follows:
(Maybe cluster expansions is an application!)

\begin{definition}
Two graphs $G_1$, $G_2$ with the same vertex set $V$ and edge set $S$
have the same connectivity structure if and
only if they have the same graphic matroids (or oriented matroids) on
$S$ and the same partition of $V$ induced by path-connectedness.

A separator-strong Tutte function $T$ of graphs is a function from a $P$-family
of graphs to ring $R$ which satisfies \eqref{TA}, \eqref{TSSM} applied to
their graphic matroids and for which $T(G_1)=T(G_2)$ if $G_1$ and $G_2$ have
the same connectivity structure.
\end{definition}


Let us say two $P$-quotients $Q_i$ and $Q_j$ are equivalent if they
have the same matroid (or oriented matroid) and have the same connectivity
structure.

\begin{lem}
$F$ is a Tutte function on a $P$-family of graphs if and only if
$F$ satisfies 
\eqref{TA} and  \eqref{TSSM}, and $F(Q_i)=F(Q_j)$ for all pairs 
of equivalent 
$P$-quotients $Q_i$ and $Q_j$.
\end{lem}

$P$-ported separator strong Tutte identities, the $\mathcal{C}$-indecomposibles
depend on $\mathcal{C}$.  $\emptyset\not\in\mathcal{C}$ is possible.  


The theorem answers a question we raised in 
\cite{TutteEx}.
When for all $e\in E$ we have 
\begin{equation}
\tag{CNF}
\label{CNF}
X_e = x_e + uy_e \text{ and } Y_e = y_e + wx_e
\end{equation}
the Tutte function is given by the following generalization of
what is often called the corank-nullity polynomial (see section \ref{Activity})
\begin{equation}
\tag{PGF}
\label{PGF}
T(M) = \sum_{A\subseteq E(M)}T(M/A \mid P)x_A y_{E\setminus A}
u^{r(M)-r(M/A\mid P)-r(A)}
w^{|A|-r(A)}.
\end{equation}
Tutte functions of this form are called
``normal'' in \cite{MR93a:05047}; their extension for $P\neq\emptyset$
is obvious.  Indeed, the ZBR theorem
is interesting because Tutte functions for some parameter
choices might fail to be normal.  Equation \ref{PGF} generalizes
to $P$-ported normal Tutte functions the corank-nullity
expansion given in Corollary 5.2 of \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}.

After verifying that the function given by this equation satisfies
the $P$-ported Tutte equations 
(following our calculations in \cite{sdcPorted}), 
we see that this $P$-ported
Tutte function of every matroid or oriented matroid exists for
arbitrary assignments of initial values $T(Q_i)$.  In \cite{TutteEx} we
utilized this fact to express an extensor-valued function $F$ of
$P$-ported graphic (and regular) oriented matroids by the assignments
$T(Q_i)=F(Q_i)$ and $u=w=0$ in \eqref{CNF}.  
It that paper, we
left open the question of whether for all parametrizations, not just
those for which \eqref{CNF} is satisfied, can the initial values
$T(Q_i)$ be assigned arbitrarilly.
Theorem \ref{BigTheorem} answers that question:
For the Tutte function to exist on $\mathcal{C}$, the $T(Q_i)$ can
be assigned arbitrarilly so long as the $(x,y,X,Y)$ parameters satisfy
identities each of the form $T(Q_i)p(x,y,X,Y)=0$ where $p$ is a 2nd or 
3rd degree polynomial in the $x,y,X$ and $Y$.  In particular, no
relation involves more than one $T(Q_i)$.

\subsection{Decomposition of Direct Sums}
a1305 61
Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi gave the following easy-to-derive
formula for a separator-strong Tutte function value of
a direct sum (with $P=\emptyset$)
\begin{equation}
T(M^1\oplus M^2) T(\emptyset) = T(M^1)T(M^2)
\end{equation}
The $P$-ported generalization is more complicated and generally cannot
be expressed by a product in the domain ring of $T$.  We can however
take advantage of the fact that every $P$-quotient $Q_i$ of 
$M=M^1\oplus M^2$ has a unique decomposition $Q_i=Q^1_{i_1}\oplus Q^2_{i_2}$
where $Q^1{i_1}$ is a $P$-quotient of $M_1$ and $Q^2_{i_2}$ is a $P$-quotient of $M_2$.

\begin{prop}
\label{SumProp}
If 
\begin{equation}
T(M^1) = \sum_{Q^1_i}T(Q^1_{i})C^1(Q^1_{i})
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
T(M^2) = \sum_{Q^2_j}T(Q^2_{i})C^2(Q^2_{j})
\end{equation}
then
\begin{equation}
\label{DSUM-MATROID}
T(M^1\oplus M^2) = \sum_{Q^1_i,Q^2_j}T(Q^1_{i}\oplus Q^2_{j})C^1(Q^1_{i})C^2(Q^2_{j}).
\end{equation}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Given computation trees 
$\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ for $T(M^1)$ and $T(M^2)$, is it
easy to construct a computation tree for $T(M^1\oplus M^2)$ by
essentially appending, say, a copy of $\mathcal{T}_2$ at each leaf node
of $\mathcal{T}_1$.  
We verify \eqref{DSUM-MATROID} term-by-term using the fact that each
leaf $L$ of $\mathcal{T}$ with $P$-quotient $Q_k$ corresponds 1-1 to a 
pair of one leaf in $\mathcal{T}_1$ with $P$-quotient $Q^1_i$ and 
one leaf in $\mathcal{T}_2$ with $P$-quotient $Q^2_j$, where
$Q_k=Q^1_i\oplus Q^2_j$.
\end{proof}


Note that the statement requires that 
$T$ be a Tutte function whose domain $\mathcal{C}$ 
contains $M^1$ and $M^2$ together with $M$.
We can express 
Proposition \ref{SumProp} algebraically using a construction similar
to one we used in \cite{sdcPorted}.   
We can write the universal Tutte polynomials
in the $R$-module freely generated by the $P$-quotients.  Then, we 
can extend this $R$-module to an algebra whose multiplication $*$
(different from but compatible with the multiplication in $R$) satisfies
\begin{equation}
Q^1_i*Q^2_j = Q^1_i\oplus Q^2_j.
\end{equation}
Then, when $T$ is the universal Tutte polynomial on $\mathcal{C}$, 
Proposition (\ref{SumProp}) is expressed by
\begin{equation}
T(M^1\oplus M^2) = T(M^1)*T(M^2).
\end{equation}
d1308 1
a1308 13



\subsection{Strong Tutte Functions}

To express a universal polynomial for $P$-ported strong Tutte functions,
we must use a ring in which the $P$-quotient expression $[Q_i]$ factors
into $[Q_i^1]\cdots[Q_i^k]$ when $Q_i$ is the direct sum 
$Q_i^1\oplus\cdots\oplus Q_i^k$.  The initial values must satisfy
$I(Q_i)=I(Q_i^1)\cdots I(Q_i^k)$.

The basis expansion originated by Tutte\cite{TutteDich}
for graphs and Crapo\cite{CrapoAct} for matroids depends on 
a particular but arbitrary ground set element order $O$.
Each basis determines a term from the internal
and external activities of elements with respect to that basis
according to the ordering $O$.
Our way to generalize is to 
restrict $O$ to orders in which
every port element is ordered before 
each $e\in E$.  (We use the convention that the deleted/contracted element
is the last, i.e., greatest element under order $O$ eligible for reduction.)

Gordan and McMahon define\cite{GordonMcMachonGreedoid} 
a ``computation tree''
to formalize the application of a subset of Tutte equations
to a matroid and some of its minors.
Each (Tutte) computation
tree determines
a polynomial in the parameters and point values.
Therefore, when
$\mathcal{N}$ is in the domain of a Tutte function, each
of these computation trees determine the same value.  
Computation
trees are a way to give
a basis expansion expression in terms of 
a more 
general definition 
of internal and external activities of elements
with respect to a basis.  The expansion is more general because it
is based on any Tutte equation computation rather than on an element order $O$.
We will extend to ported computation trees the
classification\cite{GordonMcMachonGreedoid} of elements as 
internally or externally, 
active or passive
with respect to each path down the tree.
In each case, the result is an interval
partition of the boolean subset lattice of $E$.

is determined for each linear element order.  Matroid properties
are used to show the polynomial expression are equal for orders that
differ by one pair interchange.  Therefore, all orders determine
the same value.  Then, the common value is shown to obey the 
Tutte equations.  This establishes that the Tutte equations 
have a solution.

A remarkable conclusion, given by Zaslavsky \cite{MR93a:05047} 
about the complications introduced by
parameters is that the activities expansion generalizes to

NOTES: Matroid facts used: (1) A set in which each pair of elements is
either a series pair or a parallel pair has the property that the
whole set is either a series set or a parallel set.  (2) Commutation of
deletion and contraction on series pairs and on parallel pairs.
(I.E., if $e,f$ is series, then $M/e\setminus f$ $=$ $M/f/setminus e$, and 
dually).  Commutation of ordinary pairs. (I.E., $M\setminus e /f$
$=$ $M/f\setminus e$,  $M/e/f=M/f/e$, and 
$M\setminus e\setminus f$ $=$ $M\setminus f\setminus e$.)
d1048 8

NOTES:  The computation tree activities expansions comprise all the
computations that are specified by the Tutte equations.  Therefore, it
is better to start with the Tutte equations.  It is artificial to 
start with the element-ordered computations and derive the Tutte equations
from them.
d1057 4
a1060 11
The basis expansion originated by Tutte\cite{TutteDich}
for graphs and Crapo\cite{CrapoAct} for matroids depends on 
a particular but arbitrary ground set element order $O$.
Each basis determines a term from the internal
and external activities of elements with respect to that basis
according to the ordering $O$.
Our way to generalize is to 
restrict $O$ to orders in which
every port element is ordered before 
each $e\in E$.  (We use the convention that the deleted/contracted element
is the last, i.e., greatest element under order $O$ eligible for reduction.)
d1062 5
a1066 25
Gordan and McMahon define\cite{GordonMcMachonGreedoid} 
a ``computation tree''
to formalize the application of a subset of Tutte equations
to a matroid and some of its minors.
Each (Tutte) computation
tree determines
a polynomial in the parameters and point values.
Therefore, when
$\mathcal{N}$ is in the domain of a Tutte function, each
of these computation trees determine the same value.  
Computation
trees are a way to give
a basis expansion expression in terms of 
a more 
general definition 
of internal and external activities of elements
with respect to a basis.  The expansion is more general because it
is based on any Tutte equation computation rather than on an element order $O$.
We will extend to ported computation trees the
classification\cite{GordonMcMachonGreedoid} of elements as 
internally or externally, 
active or passive
with respect to each path down the tree.
In each case, the result is an interval
partition of the boolean subset lattice of $E$.

Tutte polynomial generalization of ``pointed matroids'' which have 
one distinguished element, including its behavior on parallel and 
series connections.   Las Vergnas .. \cite{MR0419272,SetPointedLV}

a445 1
Tutte functions of graphs are defined with the multiplicative identity
d447 1
a447 45
components have a common vertex.  

Unlike Tutte functions with $P=\emptyset$, our Tutte functions of
oriented matroids will, to some extent, depend on the orientation as
well as the matroid structure.  (??? Specifically, when determining
$T(M)$, different values might be given for $T(Q_i)$ and $T(Q_j)$ for
different minors $Q_i,Q_j$ both on subsets of $P$.  When $M$ is
oriented, its minors will be oriented, so $T(Q_i)$ and $T(Q_j)$ might
be different when $Q_i$ and $Q_j$ are different orientations of the
same matroid.)

When the Tutte identities are parametrized, it is especially important
to carefully distinguish between solutions (functions of matroids that
satisfy all the relevent identities) and formal polynomials that
result from using a subset of the identities to try to calculate
$T(M)$ for one $M$.  Unlike in the non-parametrized case, even without
distinguished elements, different formal polynomials result from
different calculations.  These formal polynomials are in the
parameters, values for $T$ of loops, coloops and the initial value
$T(\emptyset)$.  Additional polynomial identities in these values must
be satisfied in order for the values together with the to have a
solution.  A solution of course means that $T(M')$ for all the
(matroid) minors of $M$ satisfy all the Tutte identities;
equivalently, all calculation sequences give the same result.  When
the parameters are all $1$, the value for each loop is $t$, the value
for each coloop is $z$ and the initial value $T(\emptyset)=1$, it is
well-known that the identities have a unique solution which is a
polynomial in $z$ and $t$.  That is the famous Tutte polynomial.  It
is well-known as a universal Tutte invariant $U(M)(t,z)$--all Tutte
invariants $F(M)$ are obtained as $F(M)=U(M)(F(U_{0,1}),F(U_{1,1})$,
where $U_{0,1}$ is the loop matroid on any ground set $\{e\}$ and
$U_{1,1}$ is the coloop matroid.  Since additional conditions
involving parameters, loop/coloop, and empty matroid values are needed
for a solution, we will avoid the term ``Tutte polynomial'' for now
and use the term Tutte function to denote any solution to the
parametrized Tutte equations.

Several recent papers have demonstrated the essential equivalences
between most different, seemingly incompatible forms for solutions of
parametrized Tutte equations (which have been called ``Tutte
polynomials'').  Their conclusions are that, like for Tutte
invariants, universal solutions can be given.  Their conclusion is
that, like for Tutte invariants, universal solutions can be given so
that every Tutte function is obtained by a variable substitution into
the universal solution.

\section*{Preliminaries}
a524 40
A function $F$ from a $P$-family $\mathcal C$ to   $R$
is called a $P$-ported parametrized separator-strong Tutte function if,
given the parameters $(x_e,y_e,X_e,Y_e)$ for each $e\in E(\mathcal{C})$
and initial values $I(Q_i)$ for all
$P$-quotients $Q_i$ in $\mathcal{C}$,
$F$ satisfies the Tutte identities for all $M\in\mathcal{C}$:
\begin{itemize}
\item
If $e\in E(M)$ (so $e\not\in P$) is a non-separator, then
\[
F(M) = x_e F(M/e) + y_e F(M\setminus e).
\]
\item
If $e\in E(M)$ and $e$ is a coloop,
\[
%F(M) = F(U_{1,1}(\{e\}))F(M/e).
F(M) = X_e F(M/e).
\]
\item
If $e\in E(M)$ and $e$ is a loop,
\[
%F(M) = F(U_{0,1}(\{e\}))F(M\setminus e).
F(M) = Y_e F(M\setminus e).
\]
\item
For each $P$-quotient $Q_i\in\mathcal{C}$,
\[
F(Q_i) = I(Q_i).
\]
We call the $P$-quotients \emph{indecomposibles} for separator-strong
$P$-ported Tutte functions.
\end{itemize}

Note that this definition means that if $F$ is a Tutte function, 
then all calculations of $F$ for $M\in\mathcal{C}$ and its
$P$-minors using the Tutte equations yield the same result.
A simple induction on $|E(M)|$ shows that if a Tutte function
exists for given 
parameter and initial values, then it is unique.

The most interesting question resolved by this theorem. ...
When for all $e\in E$ we have 
\begin{equation}
\tag{CNP}
\label{CNP}
X_e = x_e + uy_e \text{ and } Y_e = y_e + wx_e
\end{equation}
the Tutte function is given by the following generalization of
what is often called the corank-nullity polynomial
\begin{equation}
T(M) = \sum_{A\subseteq E(M)}T(M/A \mid P)x_A y_{E\setminus A}
u^{r(M)-r(M/A\mid P)-r(A)}
w^{|A|-r(A)}.
\end{equation}
After verifying that the function given by this equation satisfies
the $P$-ported Tutte equations, it follows that this $P$-ported
Tutte function of every matroid or oriented matroid exists for
arbitrary assignments of initial values $T(Q_i)$.  In \cite{TutteEx} we
utilized this fact to express an extensor-valued function $F$ of
$P$-ported graphic (and regular) oriented matroids by the assignments
$T(Q_i)=F(Q_i)$ and $u=w=0$ in \eqref{CNP}.  It that paper, we
left open the question of whether for all parametrizations, not just
those for which \eqref{CNP} is satisfied, can the initial values
$T(Q_i)$ be assigned arbitrarilly?  Theorem \ref{BigTheorem} answers that question:
For the Tutte function to exist on $\mathcal{C}$, the $T(Q_i)$ can
be assigned arbitrarilly so long as the $(x,y,X,Y)$ parameters satisfy
identities each of the form $T(Q_i)p(x,y,X,Y)=0$ where $p$ is a 2nd or 
3rd degree polynomial in the $x,y,X$ and $Y$.  In particular, no
relation involves more than one $T(Q_i)$.

One of the defining equations for the Tutte functions we study here is the
additive identity \eqref{TA} below.
It reduces to the well-known additive identity for Tutte polynomials
when the parameters are $x_e=y_e=1$ for all $e$ and the set $P=\emptyset$.
We will study the effects of distinguishing

contracted in the course of Tutte decompositions.  We call $P$ the
\emph{set of ports} and resulting Tutte polynomials 
have been called \emph{set-pointed}, \emph{ported} and 
\emph{relative.}  We prefer the terms ``port'' and ``$P$-ported identities
or functions'' because of the applications we have studied and because we can
specify a fixed $P$.
d139 66

It is known that \eqref{TA}
fails, even when $P=\emptyset$, to have a solution
$T$ except if certain algebraic relations are true about the parameters and
d220 27
a246 2
is necessary for a solution to exist.  Additional kinds of Tutte equations
entail additional conditions.
a258 8
In general, the
Tutte function $T$ is defined for $M$ when the
parameters and initial values are in a ring for which the expressions
for $T(M)$ obtained by all the possible recursive applications of the specified
Tutte equations are all equal.
For this reason, we use the term 
Tutte function for a solution to Tutte identities, rather 
than Tutte polynomial.

In this context, the additive parametrized Tutte identity applied to graph $M$
with edge set $S(M)$
is assumed only when $e$ is \emph{not} a distinguished edge.  (A
distinguished vertex remains an identifyable element within a set of
collapsed original vertices during each contraction of edges.)  The
applications, questions and results have natural generalizations to
matroids.  So, for now, we will use matroid language and refer to
graphs via their graphic matroids.

d376 3
a380 13
We first generalize to ported matroids the 
Bollobas-Riordan-Zaslavsky theorem as synthesized
by Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi in \cite{Ellis-Monaghan-Traldi}.  
This theorem applies to solutions to () and ().
These results provide a univeral Tutte
function.  Just as in the $P=\emptyset$ case, the range of this Tutte
function is in a polynomial quotient ring because in order for a
solution to exist, polynomial conditions must be satisfied among the
parameters, coloop and loop values $X_e$, $Y_e$, and initial values
$T(Q_j)$ where $Q_j$ is a matroid on a subset of $P$.  
We observe that since all oriented minors of an oriented matroid $M$
are well-defined, $T(Q_i)$ might be different from $T(Q_j)$ even if
$Q_i$ and $Q_j$ differ in orientation only.  
d397 1

components have a common vertex.  Finally, we show how some Tutte
functions of graphs can be studied as Tutte functions of an easily
constructed graphic matroid in which the original graphic matroid is
extended by elements corresponding to vertices.  Thus, our theory with
$P=V$, the vertex set of the graph, is an alternative approach to
known methods of analyzing Tutte functions of graphs.

The most interesting question resolved by this theorem. ...
When for all $e\in E$ we have 
\begin{equation}
\tag{CNP}
\label{CNP}
X_e = x_e + uy_e \text{ and } Y_e = y_e + wx_e
\end{equation}
the Tutte function is given by the following generalization of
what is often called the corank-nullity polynomial
\begin{equation}
T(M) = \sum_{A\subseteq E(M)}T(M/A \mid P)x_A y_{E\setminus A}
u^{r(M)-r(M/A\mid P)-r(A)}
w^{|A|-r(A)}.
\end{equation}
After verifying that the function given by this equation satisfies
the $P$-ported Tutte equations, it follows that this $P$-ported
Tutte function of every matroid or oriented matroid exists for
arbitrary assignments of initial values $T(Q_i)$.  In \cite{TutteEx} we
utilized this fact to express an extensor-valued function $F$ of
$P$-ported graphic (and regular) oriented matroids by the assignments
$T(Q_i)=F(Q_i)$ and $u=w=0$ in \eqref{CNP}.  It that paper, we
left open the question of whether for all parametrizations, not just
those for which \eqref{CNP} is satisfied, can the initial values
$T(Q_i)$ be assigned arbitrarilly?  Theorem \ref{BigTheorem} answers that question:
For the Tutte function to exist on $\mathcal{C}$, the $T(Q_i)$ can
be assigned arbitrarilly so long as the $(x,y,X,Y)$ parameters satisfy
identities each of the form $T(Q_i)p(x,y,X,Y)=0$ where $p$ is a 2nd or 
3rd degree polynomial in the $x,y,X$ and $Y$.  In particular, no
relation involves more than one $T(Q_i)$.

easy lemma applied to $P$-minors although it is true for all minors.
\begin{lem}
If $e$ is a separator in $M$, then $e$ is a separator in every 
($P$-)minor of $M$ containing $e$.
\end{lem}




Suppose $n=1$ and $\{e\}=E(M)$.  
%If $e$ is a separator,  $T(M)$ is 
%well-defined since $T(M)=X_e I(Q)$ or $T(M)=Y_e I(Q)$  where
%$Q=M/e$ or $Q=M\setminus e$ respectively.
Since $e$ cannot be a separator, the only
computation is $T(M)=x_e T(M/e) + y_e T(M\setminus e)$.
$M/e$ and $M\setminus e$ are $P$-quotients, so $T(M)$ is well-defined.
Therefore, $n\geq 2$.

Let us assume that there are two computations that give different 
values.

It cannot be the case that one computation starts with
$T(M)=x_e T(M/e) + y_e T(M\setminus e)$, the other starts with
$T(M)=x_f T(M/f) + y_f T(M\setminus f)$, $e$ is a non-separator in
both $M/f$ and $M\setminus f$ and $f$ is a non-separator in
both $M/e$ and $M\setminus e$.  In this case, the $T$ would
d737 10
a746 7
Both computations give the same value because in this situation,
the reductions by $e$ and $f$ commute.

So, for $M$ to be a counterexample, there must be two
computations that start with two different $e,f$ which satisfy
one of the following two lemmas:

For the purposes of this paper it was sufficient to recognize
that our extensor valued ported parametrized Tutte function of 
unimodular oriented matroids belongs to the natural generalization 
of Zaslavsky's normal class.  As such, it has, for arbitrary
parameters, expressions obtained by substitutions into
(1) computation trees, (2) ported parametrized Tutte polynomials
from such trees, (3) various $P$-subbasis expansions, 
and (4) the ported parametrized corank-nullity polynomial.

We state here the open problem to include ports into the results of 
Zaslavsky, Bollobas and Riordan, and Ellis-Monaghan and Traldi:
Can we classify with universal forms all of the ported parametrized Tutte
functions according to their parameters, non-port
point values, and the 
values on oriented or unoriented minors on port ground sets?

The Tutte polynomial is a well-known invariant of graphs and matroids.  Several
related polynomials have applications that involve graphs whose edges each bear
one or more weights and/or some of whose edges (or vertices) are distinguished.

is assumed only when $e$ is \emph{not} a distinguished edge.  (A distinguished vertex
remains an identifyable element within a set of collapsed original vertices
during each contraction of edges.)  The applications, questions
and results have natural generalizations to matroids.  So, for now, we will
use matroid language and refer to graphs via their graphic matroids.

when these identities are restricted to apply only when
$e\not\in P$.  Solutions to \ref{A-P-T-identity} and \ref{M-P-T-identities}
are called \emph{Tutte functions}.  We first present a univeral Tutte function.  Just as 
in the $P=\emptyset$ case, the range of this Tutte function is in a polynomial quotient
ring because in order for a solution to exist,
polynomial conditions must be satisfied among the parameters, 
coloop and loop values $X_e$, $Y_e$, and 
initial values $T(Q_j)$ where $Q_j$ is a matroid on a subset of $P$.  Second, we
extend to the $P\ne \emptyset$ the activities expressions and corresponding
interval partitions of the Boolean lattice $2^{S(M)\setminus P}$ for Tutte functions.
Like the activities expressions given by GM for greedoid Tutte polynomials,
the expressions we present are not just those obtained when a fixed
linear ordering on the elements is used to determine for which element 
$e$ to apply \ref{A-P-T-identity} when two or more elements are eligible.
Each of our activities expressions is based on a formal (Tutte) 
\emph{computation tree} as defined by GM.  Thus our activities expansions
generalize those given by DH.  


Tutte functions of graphs are defined with 
the multiplicative identity modified with a factor
that accounts for whether the 2-connected components have a common vertex.
Finally, we show how some Tutte functions of 
graphs can be studied as Tutte functions of an easily constructed graphic matroid
in which the original graphic matroid is extended by elements corresponding
to vertices.  Thus, our theory with $P=V$, the vertex set of the graph, is 
an alternative approach to known methods of analyzing Tutte functions of graphs.

Unlike Tutte functions with $P=\emptyset$, our Tutte functions of oriented
matroids will, to some extent, depend on the orientation as well as the 
matroid structure.  (??? Specifically, when determining
$T(M)$, different values might be given
for $T(Q_i)$ and $T(Q_j)$ for different minors $Q_i,Q_j$ both on subsets
of $P$.  When $M$ is oriented, its minors will be oriented,
so $T(Q_i)$ and $T(Q_j)$ might be different
when $Q_i$ and $Q_j$ are different orientations of the same 
matroid.)
d151 33
a183 29
When the Tutte identities are parametrized, it is especially important to carefully
distinguish between solutions (functions of matroids that satisfy all the relevent
identities) and formal polynomials that result from using a subset of the 
identities to try to calculate $T(M)$ for one $M$.  Unlike in the non-parametrized
case, even without distinguished elements, different formal polynomials
result from different calculations.  These formal polynomials
are in the parameters, values for $T$ of loops, coloops and the initial value $T(\emptyset)$.
Additional polynomial identities in these
values must be satisfied in order for the values together with the to have 
a solution.  A solution of course means that $T(M')$ for all the (matroid) minors of $M$
satisfy all the Tutte identities; equivalently, all calculation sequences give
the same result.  When the parameters are all $1$, the value for each loop is
$t$, the value for each coloop is $z$ and the initial value $T(\emptyset)=1$,
it is well-known that the identities have a unique solution which is a 
polynomial in $z$ and $t$.  That is the famous Tutte polynomial.  It is well-known
as a universal Tutte invariant $U(M)(t,z)$--all Tutte invariants $F(M)$ are obtained
as $F(M)=U(M)(F(U_{0,1}),F(U_{1,1})$, where $U_{0,1}$ is the loop matroid on 
any ground set $\{e\}$ and $U_{1,1}$ is the coloop matroid.
Since additional
conditions involving parameters, loop/coloop, and empty matroid values are
needed for a solution, we will avoid the term ``Tutte polynomial'' for now
and use the term Tutte function to denote any solution to the parametrized Tutte equations.

Several recent papers have demonstrated the essential equivalences between most
different, seemingly incompatible forms for solutions of parametrized Tutte equations
(which have been called ``Tutte polynomials'').  Their conclusions are that, like
for Tutte invariants, universal solutions can be given.
Their conclusion is that, like for Tutte invariants, universal solutions can be
given so that every Tutte function is obtained by a variable substitution into
