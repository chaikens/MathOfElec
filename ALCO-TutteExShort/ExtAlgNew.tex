\begin{abstract}
 The matrix tree theorem expresses the basis enumeration Tutte function
(spanning tree count of connected graphic matroids) as a
determinant--a minor of the graph's Laplacian. We will generalize the
choice of a root vertex for the trees by distinguishing a fixed set $P$
of $p$ matroid elements, which we will call ports, a word from
engineering. We then define a function from $K$-linear matrix
representations of matroid pairs ($N_{\alpha},N_{\beta})$
(often $N_{\alpha}=N_{\beta}$) whose ground sets
include $P$, into pure (decomposible)
exterior algebra elements which represent points in the Grassmannian of $p$ dimensional $K$-linear subspaces
of $K^{(2p)}$. We express this subspace value as a decomposible
(i.e. product of vectors) element in the exterior algebra (of
anti-symmetric tensors) over $K^{(2p)}$, in a standard way.  The result is
a restricted or set-pointed Tutte function $\ext{L}_E(N_{\alpha},N_{\beta})$
that
satisfies sign-corrected forms of the two familiar identities for
deletion/contraction of elements not in $P$, and for disjoint
union. Note that these identities are in exterior algebra, whose
multiplication is anti-commutative. This generalizes the all-minors
directed graph matrix tree theorem (proved combinatorially by the
author) because those minors are the coefficients in the expansion of
$T$'s value over the standard basis--they are the standardized \Plucker
coordinates for the dimension $p$ subspace $T$'s value represents.  An
unusual feature for this Tutte-like function is that when $K$ is ordered
so the matroids are oriented, $T$ can distinguish different orientations
of the same matroid.

\section{Introduction}


The subject of Tutte functions is one of the most prominent
in classical and contemporary discrete mathematics. Recent
developments have been made in algebraic frameworks which provide
grounds for multiple function domains and analogies,
and for analysis of convolutions.
It might therefore be interesting to see some Tutte functions valued
in exterior algebras.  Unlike the classical and recent frameworks
we are aware of, 
exterior algebras \cite{MarcusFDMuAlPt2} have \emph{anticommutative} multiplication.

As usual, a matroid representation is a subspace
of a vector space equipped with a particular basis $S$
identified with the matroid's ground set.  Let $P \subseteq S$.
Our exterior
algebra valued Tutte function emerges as a restriction, to represented matroids,
of a specialization of
the so-called relative, set-pointed, or what we call ``$P$-ported''
Tutte functions \cite{MR0419272,SetPointedLV,sdcPorted,TutteEx,RelTuttePolyDiaoHetyei}.
These functions obey the deletion-contraction
identity only for $e\not\in P$.  When the matroid is regular and
the representation is the row space of a full-row rank unimodular matrix $N$, and $P=\emptyset$,
our function reduces to the basis counting Tutte function; it is the determinant
of $N N^t$.  Now, when $N$ is the reduced $\pm 1$-entry incidence matrix of a graph, the
matroid is graphic, and fact that $|N N^t|$ equals the number of bases, i.e. maximal forests,
is the well-known Matrix-Tree theorem.

The facts that the Matrix-Tree theorem determinant is $|N N^t|$, and its directed graph version
asserts that $|N_1 (N_2)^t|$ enumerates rooted maximal forests (where $N_1=N$ and 0-1 matrix $N_2$
encodes incidences of
an edge with its tail vertex) naturally lead us to construct our Tutte functions for \emph{pairs}
of matroid representations.  

Let the pure tensor $\mathbf{N}$
determined $\mathcal{N}$ be defined
by the exterior product 
of the rows of $N$, up to non-zero $K$ multiples.  Its 
decomposition begins but does not completely fulfill a Tutte function analogy:
\begin{equation}\label{extDaC}
  \text{for all } e \in E, \mathbf{N} =
  \mathbf{e}\wedge(\mathbf{N}/\mathbf{e}) +
  (\mathbf{N}\setminus \mathbf{e}).
\end{equation}
These \emph{contraction} and \emph{deletion} operations are defined up to sign
by extending the vector space operations of projecttion and quotient
(by subspace $<\mathbf{e}>$) to exterior algebra.  (We will adopt comventions
to make (\ref{extDaC}) an identity.)
