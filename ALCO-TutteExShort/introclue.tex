Let $M=N N^t$ or $N_1 (N_2)^t$, and let $p$ denote the order of these square matrices.
The clue to what happens next appears when
we concatenate the identity matrix to get $H=[I M]$.  The maximal (order $p$)
minors of $H$ are up to sign the minors of all orders of $M$.  The $\binom{2p}{p}$-tuple
of minors of $H$ represents the Plucker coordinates of the row-space of $H$.  (A detailed
description of how each of these minors enumerates graphic structures appears in
a previous paper \cite{}.)

Let us add to $G$...




%But $H$ also has a graphical description.
