%   This is a sample bibliography file, with examples of references
% to books, articles, articles in books and unpublished works.
%
%   Each entry is of the form -at sign-XXXXX{....} (do not forget the closing brace), 
% where AAA is the code used in the \cite{AAA} command to refer to this entry.
%   Note that each element must be included within quotation marks "..." or
% braces {...}, and that a comma must follow.
%   If you wish to capitalize letters in titles, put them into braces (this is
% not necessary for the first letter of the first word).
