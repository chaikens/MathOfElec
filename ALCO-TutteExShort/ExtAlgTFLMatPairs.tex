\begin{abstract}
 The matrix tree theorem expresses the basis enumeration Tutte function
(spanning tree count of connected graphic matroids) as a
determinant--a minor of the graph's Laplacian. We will generalize the
choice of a root vertex for the trees by distinguishing a fixed set $P$
of $p$ matroid elements, which we will call ports, a word from
engineering. We then define a function from $k$-linear matrix
representations of matroid pairs ($N_{\alpha},N_{\beta})$ (often
$N_{\alpha}=N_{\beta}$ whose ground sets
include $P$, into pure (decomposible)
exterior algebra elements which represent points in the Grassmannian of $p$ dimensional $k$-linear subspaces
of $k^{(2p)}$. We express this subspace value as a decomposible
(i.e. product of vectors) element in the exterior algebra (of
anti-symmetric tensors) over $k^{(2p)}$, in a standard way.  The result is
a restricted or set-pointed Tutte function $\ext{F}_E(N_{\alpha},N_{\beta})$
that
satisfies sign-corrected forms of the two familiar identities for
deletion/contraction of elements not in $P$, and for disjoint
union. Note that these identities are in exterior algebra, whose
multiplication is anti-commutative. This generalizes the all-minors
directed graph matrix tree theorem (proved combinatorially by the
author) because those minors are the coefficients in the expansion of
$T$'s value over the standard basis--they are the standardized Plucker
coordinates for the dimension $p$ subspace $T$'s value represents.  An
unusual feature for this Tutte-like function is that when $k$ is ordered
so the matroids are oriented, $T$ can distinguish different orientations
of the same matroid.

\section{Introduction}

\noindent

Tutte functions are a well-known, long-standing idea
for which new applications, variations and generalizations
continue to be active research subjects.
One of the earliest Tutte function is the basis enumerator for matroids. It
is a determinant in the case of graphic, and more generally, regular matroids;
this is a consequence of the Cauchy-Binet theorem.
The well-known Matrix Tree theorem tells us this determinant (up to sign)
is any full-rank minor of the graph's Laplacian matrix. More generally,
every minor is an enumerator for (signed, in some non-principal minor
cases) forests satisfying the following condition: Each vertex indexing
a deleted row is in exactly one of the trees, and similary for each
vertex indexing a deleted column\cite{sdcMTT}. (Each forest's sign depends on the sign of the
matching the forest determines between the deleted row vertices and
deleted column vertices; of course when the minor is principal,
the only such matching is the identity.)
We give a key observation: \emph{Each} such
minor, when $e$ is a given edge, equals the sum of the corresponding
minor when $e$ is deleted plus the determinant expansion terms for
forests that contain $e$.  The latter can be also be expressed as a
determinant.
In the following, we will develop a formulation in which
\emph{all these minors together},
when they are constituted as an element of an exterior algebra, satisfy the
well-known Tutte identities.

In order for a tuple of determinants to be a Tutte function value, one
must label them in a combinatorial way.  For this purpose, we use
the \emph{set-pointed}, also called the \emph{relative} or \emph{ported}
variation of Tutte functions.  Let $P$ be a set.  A function $F$ is a set $P$ pointed or $P$-ported
Tutte function, or a relative Tutte function with respect to $P$, when the
identity for deletion and contraction of $e$ is asserted only when $e \not\in P$.
$P$ will play the role of vertices in our all-minors matrix tree theorem specialization.

Let $P_{\alpha}$ and $P_{\beta}$ be disjoint copies of $P$.  Let $K$ be a field.
We will see that our Tutte function's value will be an exterior product of
$|P|$ vectors in the vector space over $K$ with basis $P_\alpha \cup P_\beta$.
In other words, it will be a ``pure'' or ``decomposible'' element of rank $|P|$
in the exterior algebra over our vector space.  As such, (when non-zero)
it \emph{represents} some
dimension $P$ subspace, a point in the Grassmannian $Gr(|P|,2|P|)$.
However, in order for Tutte's additive identity to make sense, the value cannot be
a point in a projective space like the one containing the variety $Gr(|P|,2|P|)$.


The theory works when parameters $r_e$, $g_e$ are given for each element $e\not\in P$. We
will have, formally,
\[
   F(N) = g_eF(N/e)+r_eF(N\backslash e) \text{ if\ }e\text{ can be deleted and contracted, and }e\not\in P.
   \]
Indeed, our chief motivation is to give an algebraic combinatorial description of solutions
to electrical network problems, where the parameters will represent the coefficient
in Ohm's law.  It is convenient (and elegant) to write that law in homogeneous form:
For each resistor $e$ there
are two parameters $r_e,g_e$ such that $i_e$ is the current through the resistor and $v_e$ is
the voltage drop across the resistor (in the direction of the current) if and only if there
exists a value $x_e$ for which $i_e=g_ex_e$ and $v_e=r_ex_e$.  In other words, when they
are non-zero and not infinite, the conventional
resistance is $r_e/g_e$ and conductance is $g_e/r_e$. Shorts (zero resistance) and opens (zero
conductance) are thus accomodated.
