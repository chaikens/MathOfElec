\section{An Exchange Propery}

It is well-known that a series-parallel subgraph, defined as 
a graph with
no subgraph homeomorphic to $K_4$, is equivalent to a subgraph of an
$st$-series-parallel network.  Here an $st$-series-parallel network
is has distinguished ``port'' edge $st$ and is constructable from 
single edge $st$-series-parallel networks using the series and
parallel connection operations.  A single edge $st$-series-parallel 
network has one ``ordinary'' edge in parallel with the port edge.
All graphs can have multiple edges unless otherwise indicated.

\begin{theorem}
Let $G$ be a series-parallel subgraph 
with two designated vertices $s$ and $t$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Whenever $s,t$ are vertices and
$F_0$ and $F_1$ are forest subgraphs in $G$ for which
$F_1$ contains an $st$ path $P$, there is a unique 
subset $A\subseteq P\setminus F_0$ for which 
$F_0\cup A$ is a forest that contains an $st$ path $P'$
for which $A\subseteq P'$.

\item In this situation, let $F_1'=F_0\cup A$, which contains path $P'$,
and $F_0'=F_1\setminus A$.   $A$ is also the unique subset 
$A\subseteq P'\setminus F_0'$ for which 
$F_0'\cup A$ is a forest that contains an $st$ path $P$
for which $A\subseteq P$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}


{\bf Remark:} When $F_0=\emptyset$, the property is satisfied with
$A=P$.  When $F_0$ contains an $st$ path, the property is
satisfied with $A=\emptyset$.

\begin{proof}
If $F_1$ doesn't contain an $st$ path,
there is nothing to prove.  So,  assume $F_1$ contains $st$ path $P$.
Note that if a forest contains an $st$-path then
that $st$ path is unique.


If $F_0$ also contains an $st$ path, we claim the theorem is satisfied by
$A=\emptyset$.  $F_0\cup\emptyset$ is a forest with 
$st$ path $P'$, and clearly $A=\emptyset\subseteq P'$.  
To prove $A=\emptyset$ is unique, suppose $A\neq \emptyset$ 
also satisfies the theorem, so
$F_0\cup A$ is a forest.  Since $F_0\cup A$ is a forest, 
$P'$ is the unique $st$ path in $F_0\cup A$.  Therefore, 
$A\subseteq P'\setminus F_0$.  But $P'\subseteq F_0$, so
$A\neq\emptyset$ is contradicted.

We therefore verified that when $F_0$ contains an $st$ path,
$A=\emptyset$ uniquely satisfies (1) of the theorem.
In this situation, $F_0'=F_1\setminus A=F_1$ contains the 
unique path $P$, so $\emptyset=A$ is the only set for 
which $F_0'\cup A$ is a forest that contains an $st$ path $P$
for which $A\subseteq P$.

So, let us assume that $F_0$ does not contain an $st$ path.  

The following structural characterization
of an $st$ series-parallel subgraph
facilitates the proof:

An $st$ series-parallel subgraph
is either the edgeless graph with vertices $s,t$, a one-edge 
graph with vertices $s,t$, or is graph composed from
already constructed $st$ series-parallel subgraphs by series or
by parallel connection along the $st$ terminals.  See the figure.

We proceed
by induction on the number of the above series or 
parallel construction steps for 
$G$.

The theorem has been verified for the graph $G$ with vertices $s,t$ and no
edges.  For the one-edge graph $e=st$, we need check only $F_0=\emptyset$
and $F_1=\{e\}$.  In this case, it is immediate that only $A=\{e\}$
satisfies the conclusion.

So, we assume $G$ is the parallel connection along $s,t$ of two graphs
constructed with fewer steps, or is the series connection along $s,t$ of such 
graphs.  Let the subgraphs be $G^1$ and $G^2$.
Let $F_i^j=F_i\cap G^j$  for $i=0,1$
and $j=1,2$.  Recall that we can assume that $F_0$ does not
contain an $st$ path.

Consider the case of parallel connection.  
Let's assume the $st$ path $P$ in $F_1$ is contained
in $F_1^1\subseteq G^1$, otherwise reverse the roles of $G^1$, $G^2$.
There cannot be an $st$ path in $F_1^2$, because
that path together with $P$ would be a circuit, which
contradicts $F^1$ being a forest.

By induction, $A$ is the unique subset of $P$ for which
$F_0^1\cup A$ is a forest in $G^1$ that 
contains $st$ path $P'$ with $A\subseteq P'$. 
Since $F_0^2$ is a forest without an $st$ path,
$F_0\cup A=F_0^1\cup A\cup F_0^2$ is a forest 
in $G$ that contains $st$ path $P'$.  Therefore, (1) is confirmed.

\end{center}


Now for series connection.  
The $st$ path $P$ in $F_1$ is uniquely
partitioned into two interterminal paths $P^1$ and 
$P^2$ in $F_1^1$ and $F_1^2$ respectively.  By induction,
there are unique $A^1$ and $A^2$ satifiying the theorem
for $F_0^1,F_1^1$ and $F_0^2,F_1^2$ respectively.
The theorem for $F_0,F_1$ is now satisfied with $A^1\cup A^2$.

\end{proof}


\section{Converses}

The only obstacle to the uniqueness seems to be 
two $st$ paths with at least one common edge
$e$ where $e$ is traversed in opposite directions
when traversing the two $st$ paths.  Let $G^+$ be $G$ with
a new edge $st$ added. In this situation,
it is known that there is in $G+$ a subgraph homeomorphic to $K_4$.
The $K_4$ homoeomorph is comprised of 6 edge-disjoint paths, and
$e$ and $st$ are in two of the pairs of paths that are 
also vertex disjoint.
