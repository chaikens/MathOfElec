The present report will clarify how our 
generalizations of Foss\'{e}prez, Hasler and Neirynck's conditions
for unique solvability
are equivalent to the characterization of $\mathcal{W}_0$ matrix pairs
shown by Sandberg and Willson \cite{SWExistancePf,W0APPLpaper}:
They are equivalent combinatorial 
conditions for the unique solvability
of a \textit{common}
%(not just similar)
problem with monotone non-linearities.
A third known variant due to Nishi and Chua 
\cite{NishiChuaCactus,NishiChuaCCCS} is based on 
deletion/contraction operations applicable
to various kinds of primative
1 and 2-port elements to produce ``cactus graph'' networks,
which are then analyzed with the signs of determinants 
of their matrices.
